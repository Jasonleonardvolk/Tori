# ALAN Phase-Coherent Reasoning System

## Overview

The ALAN Phase-Coherent Reasoning System demonstrates a novel approach to logical inference based on oscillator dynamics and phase synchronization rather than traditional truth values or probability. This "post-probabilistic" foundation for intelligent inference allows reasoning to emerge naturally from the dynamics of ALAN's conceptual system without requiring explicit logical rules.

## Key Components

This implementation builds on ALAN's Phase IV semantic sovereignty components:

1. **Phase Reasoning Module** (`phase_reasoning.py`)
   - Core implementation of phase-coherent reasoning
   - Manages premise networks, inference testing, and modal reasoning

2. **Comprehensive Architectural Design** (`ALAN_PHASE_COHERENT_REASONING.md`)
   - Detailed system architecture
   - Mathematical foundations
   - Integration with Phase IV components

3. **Interactive Demonstration** (`demo_phase_reasoning.py`)
   - Showcases phase-coherent inference capabilities
   - Demonstrates modal reasoning
   - Shows context-sensitive inference

## Conceptual Foundation

Unlike traditional reasoning systems that operate on static truth values or probabilistic estimates, ALAN's phase-coherent reasoning is based on the following principles:

- **Truth as Phase Coherence**: Logical consistency is measured by the stability and synchronization of phase relationships between concepts
- **Inference as Synchronization**: A conclusion is valid if it can join a phase-locked cluster of premises without disrupting coherence
- **Modal Logic as Attractor Dynamics**: Necessary truths synchronize across all stable attractor configurations; possible truths in at least one
- **Context as Phase Environment**: Different contexts create different phase configurations, allowing for context-sensitive reasoning

## Mathematical Foundation

The system is built on established mathematical models:

- **Kuramoto Model**: Coupled phase oscillators that naturally synchronize under the right conditions
- **Koopman Operator Theory**: Provides a framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamics through linear operators
- **Phase Order Parameters**: Measures of coherence and synchronization in oscillator networks
- **Attractor Basin Analysis**: Characterizes the stability and likelihood of different phase configurations

## Usage

### Running the Demo

1. Use the provided batch file:
   ```
   start_reasoning_demo.bat
   ```

2. Or run the Python script directly:
   ```
   python demo_phase_reasoning.py
   ```

3. To save the demonstration output to a JSON file:
   ```
   python demo_phase_reasoning.py --save-output
   ```

### Integration with ALAN

The phase-coherent reasoning engine is fully integrated with ALAN's Phase IV components:

- **Memory Sculptor**: Concept stability is enhanced by successful inferences; disruption recorded as desyncs
- **Ontology Refactor Engine**: Reasoning patterns suggest merge/split operations for concepts
- **Ghost Label Synthesizer**: Inference patterns inform semantic role assignment for concept naming

## Key Advantages

This approach to reasoning offers several advantages over traditional systems:

1. **Emergence**: Complex logical relationships emerge from simple phase dynamics without explicit rules
2. **Continuity**: Degrees of validity emerge naturally without ad-hoc probabilistic assignments
3. **Context-Sensitivity**: Reasoning adapts to specific contexts through phase configurations
4. **Integration**: Seamless connection with existing phase-based knowledge representation
5. **Biological Plausibility**: More aligned with neural synchronization mechanisms in brain

## Future Directions

The current implementation is a foundation that can be extended in several directions:

1. **Advanced Koopman Analysis**: Incorporate more sophisticated techniques for dynamical analysis
2. **Multi-Scale Phase Coupling**: Support reasoning across different levels of abstraction
3. **Interactive Concept Exploration**: Visualization tools for exploring phase relationships
4. **Learning from Phase Patterns**: Extract patterns from successful reasoning to improve future inferences
5. **Quantum-Inspired Extensions**: Explore connections to quantum cognition through phase relationships

## Implementation Notes

- The implementation uses a simplified approximation of Koopman operators
- Phase dynamics are based on a modified Kuramoto model
- All core components follow the singleton pattern for consistency
