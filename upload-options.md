# Options for uploading project-index.txt

We've created a project index file (`project-index.txt`) that contains paths to important files in your repository. Here are options for uploading it to cloud storage:

## Option 1: Using Azure Storage (if you have Azure CLI installed)

```powershell
# Install Azure CLI if needed (run as administrator)
# winget install -e --id Microsoft.AzureCLI

# Log in to Azure
az login

# Create a storage account and container (if they don't exist)
$RESOURCE_GROUP="YourResourceGroup"
$STORAGE_ACCOUNT="youraccountname"
$CONTAINER_NAME="chopin"

# Upload the file
az storage blob upload --account-name $STORAGE_ACCOUNT --container-name $CONTAINER_NAME --name "project-index.txt" --file "project-index.txt" --auth-mode login
```

## Option 2: Using AWS S3 (if you have AWS CLI installed)

```powershell
# Configure AWS CLI if needed
# aws configure

# Upload the file
aws s3 cp project-index.txt s3://your-bucket-name/Chopin/project-index.txt
```

## Option 3: Run Google Cloud SDK with elevated permissions

To resolve the permission issue with Google Cloud SDK:

1. Run PowerShell as Administrator
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\jason\Desktop\tori\kha"
   ```
3. Execute the upload script:
   ```powershell
   .\upload-to-gcs.ps1
   ```

## Option 4: Manual upload through web interface

1. Go to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Navigate to Cloud Storage > Buckets
3. Find or create the "chopinbucket1" bucket
4. Navigate to the "Chopin" folder (create it if needed)
5. Click "Upload files" and select the project-index.txt file
