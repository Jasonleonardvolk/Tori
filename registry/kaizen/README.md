# Î©-Orchestrator Kaizen Loop

The Kaizen Loop is a structured process for continuous improvement of the TORI platform's components through measurable, automated, and reproducible changes.

## Overview

The Kaizen Loop follows a six-stage cycle:
1. **Plan**: Identify pain points and create improvement tickets
2. **Create**: Generate code changes and tests
3. **Evaluate**: Run benchmarks in sandboxes
4. **Deploy**: Roll out changes to a small subset of users
5. **Observe**: Monitor performance metrics
6. **Learn**: Promote successful changes or roll back problematic ones

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyYAML
- Access to component metrics (Prometheus/Grafana)

### Quick Start

1. **List available components**:
   ```batch
   kaizen components
   ```

2. **Create a new Kaizen ticket**:
   ```batch
   kaizen new "Improve memory utilization in MCP server" --component pcc-main --severity medium
   ```

3. **List all tickets**:
   ```batch
   kaizen list
   ```

4. **See ticket details**:
   ```batch
   kaizen show KAIZ-001
   ```

5. **Update ticket status**:
   ```batch
   kaizen update KAIZ-001 --status in_progress
   ```

## Kaizen Ticket Structure

Each Kaizen ticket consists of:

### 1. Kaizen-Tkt.yml

Contains metadata about the improvement, including:
- ID and title
- Component being improved
- Owner
- Objective
- Success and abort criteria
- Rollback plan

### 2. Patch-Spec.md

Technical documentation for the improvement, including:
- Summary of the changes
- Components modified
- Configuration changes
- Benchmark results
- Rollback procedure

### 3. Score-card.json

Results of the evaluation phase:
- Performance metrics
- Test results
- Comparison with previous version

### 4. Promotion-Log

Audit trail of status changes and approvals.

## Ticket Lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Initial ticket creation
2. **Planned**: Improvement plan approved
3. **In Progress**: Implementation underway
4. **In Review**: Peer review and testing
5. **Canary**: Deployed to a subset of users
6. **Complete**: Successfully deployed and verified
7. **Aborted**: Failed to meet criteria and rolled back

## CLI Reference

The Kaizen CLI provides the following commands:

- `kaizen new`: Create a new Kaizen ticket
- `kaizen list`: List all Kaizen tickets
- `kaizen show`: Show details of a specific ticket
- `kaizen update`: Update a ticket's properties
- `kaizen component`: Create a new component definition
- `kaizen components`: List available components

Run `kaizen --help` for more details.

## Component Registry

Components are registered in YAML files under `registry/kaizen/components/`. Each component has:

- ID and name
- Tier (criticality level)
- Owner
- SLO metrics
- Default rollback plan

## Example Workflow

1. Team identifies a performance issue with MCP server
2. Create a Kaizen ticket with specific success criteria
3. Implement changes with tests
4. Run in sandbox with traffic replay
5. Deploy to 1% of users
6. Monitor metrics
7. If successful, promote; otherwise, roll back

## Governance

Each Kaizen ticket requires:
1. Explicit success and abort criteria
2. Reliable metrics to measure impact
3. Clear rollback procedure
4. Approval before promotion

## Integration with CI/CD

The Kaizen Loop integrates with the CI/CD pipeline:
1. CI builds and tests changes
2. Scorecard is generated based on test results
3. Canary deployment is triggered automatically
4. Metrics are collected and analyzed
5. Promote/rollback decision is made based on SLOs

## Next Steps

- Link tickets to GitHub pull requests
- Create Grafana dashboards for each component
- Set up alerting for SLO violations
- Implement automated traffic replay
