# Kaizen Ticket: Optimize MCP Server for 200Hz Throughput

id: KAIZ-001
title: "Optimize MCP server for 200Hz throughput"
component: pcc-main
owner: backend-team
severity: high
objective: "Achieve p95 latency below 10ms at 200Hz message rate with delta-based JSON encoding"

success_criteria:
  - "P95 latency < 10ms at 200Hz throughput as measured by test_pcc_broadcast.py"
  - "Zero message drops during 5-minute stability test"
  - "Memory usage remains below 200MB during peak load"
  - "CPU usage remains below 50% on a standard server instance"

abort_criteria:
  - "Message drop rate exceeds 0.5%"
  - "P95 latency exceeds 15ms"
  - "Memory leak detected (continuous growth over time)"

rollback_plan: "systemctl restart mcp-server@stable"
