## SBOM Changes Detected

The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) has changed in the latest build. This could indicate:

1. **New dependencies added** - These should be reviewed for security implications
2. **Dependency versions updated** - Check if these address known vulnerabilities
3. **Dependencies removed** - Verify this was intentional

### Details

**Artifacts containing the full diff are available in the workflow run.**

### Required Actions

Security team, please:

1. Download and review the SBOM diff from the artifacts
2. Verify no CVEs or critical issues exist in the new dependency graph

4. If issues are found, create tickets for remediation
