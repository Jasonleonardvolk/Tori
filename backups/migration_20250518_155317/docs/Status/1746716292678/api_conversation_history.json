[{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<task>\nwhat do we have setup that is our alternative to this:\n1. AI-native Git: Rethinking version control for AI agents\nNow that AI agents increasingly write or modify large portions of application code, what developers care about starts to change. We‚Äôre no longer fixated on exactly what code was written line-by-line, but rather on whether the output behaves as expected. Did the change pass the tests? Does the app still work as intended? \n\nThis flips a long-standing mental model: Git was designed to track the precise history of hand-written code, but, with coding agents, that granularity becomes less meaningful. Developers often don‚Äôt audit every diff ‚Äî especially if the change is large or auto-generated ‚Äî they just want to know whether the new behavior aligns with the intended outcome. As a result, the Git SHA ‚Äî once the canonical reference for ‚Äúthe state of the codebase‚Äù ‚Äî begins to lose some of its semantic value. \n\nA SHA tells you that something changed, but not why or whether it‚Äôs valid. In AI-first workflows, a more useful unit of truth might be a combination of the prompt that generated the code and the tests that verify its behavior. In this world, the ‚Äústate‚Äù of your app might be better represented by the inputs to generation (prompt, spec, constraints) and a suite of passing assertions, rather than a frozen commit hash. In fact, we might eventually track prompt+test bundles as versionable units in their own right, with Git relegated to tracking those bundles, not just raw source code.\n\nTaking this a step further: In agent-driven workflows, the source of truth may shift upstream toward prompts, data schemas, API contracts, and architectural intent. Code becomes the byproduct of those inputs, more like a compiled artifact than a manually authored source. Git, in this world, starts to function less as a workspace and more as an artifact log ‚Äî a place to track not just what changed, but why and by whom. We may begin to layer in richer metadata, such as which agent or model made a change, which sections are protected, and where human oversight is required ‚Äì or where AI reviewers like Diamond can step in as part of the loop.\n</task>"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\nclient/src/README-WIREFRAMES.md\n\n# VSCode Open

The implementation follows a componentized approach to match the wireframe structure.\r\n\r\n## Implemented Components\r\n\r\n### 1. Concept Field Canvas (`/components/ConceptFieldCanvas/`)\r\n\r\n- **Core Canvas**: Visualizes the concept graph embedded in Œ∫-space \r\n- **Interactive Elements**: Selection, hover, and interaction support\r\n- **Overlays**:\r\n  - Phase dynamics (HSV color visualization)\r\n  - Coupling strength (edge thickness)\r\n  - Resonance (node size and pulsing)\r\n  - Koopman vectors (arrow visualization)\r\n- **Controls**:\r\n  - Geometry switching (Euclidean, spherical, hyperbolic)\r\n  - Alpha parameter adjustment\r\n  - Morph execution controls\r\n\r\n### 2. Agent Panel System (`/components/AgentPanel/`)\r\n\r\n- **Agent Tabs**: \r\n  - Refactor Agent (algorithm suggestions)\r\n  - Debug Agent (anomaly detection)\r\n  - Doc Agent (documentation generation)\r\n  - Memory Agent (project history)\r\n  - Console Agent (direct interaction)\r\n- **Suggestion Cards**:\r\n  - Rich display of agent suggestions with metrics\r\n  - Action buttons for accepting, modifying, or dismissing\r\n- **Configuration Controls**:\r\n  - Agent autonomy settings (passive, active, autopilot)\r\n  - Mode-specific controls for each agent type\r\n\r\n### 3. Field Meditation Mode (`/components/FieldMeditationMode/`)\r\n\r\n- **Time Controls**: Play/pause, step forward/backward\r\n- **Visualization Panels**:\r\n  - Koopman Spectrum Trail\r\n  - Spectral Entropy Wave  \r\n  - Phase Field Canvas (over time)\r\n- **Parameter Display**: Time, alpha, geometry settings\r\n\r\n## Main Layout\r\n\r\nAll these components are assembled in the `AlanIDELayout.jsx` component, which:\r\n\r\n- Arranges the ConceptFieldCanvas and AgentPanel in a side-by-side layout\r\n- Provides a mode switcher to toggle Field Meditation Mode\r\n- Maintains state and handles communication between components\r\n\r\n## Using the Implementation\r\n\r\nTo use this implementation:\r\n\r\n1. The default view shows the main Concept Field Canvas with the Agent Panel sidebar\r\n2. Click the \"Field Meditation\" button in the header to switch to Field Meditation Mode\r\n3. In Field Meditation Mode, use the playback controls to visualize field dynamics over time\r\n4. Click \"Exit Mode\" to return to the main interface\r\n\r\n## Design System\r\n\r\nThe implementation uses the design system tokens defined in `theme.css`, including:\r\n\r\n- Color palette with light/dark theming support\r\n- Spacing and typography scales\r\n- Border radii, shadows, and transitions\r\n- Consistent UI elements and control styling\r\n\r\n## Future Enhancements\r\n\r\nAs part of Phase 3, this wireframe implementation will be connected to:\r\n\r\n- Real data from Python project parsing\r\n- Live code editing with bidirectional sync\r\n- Execution monitoring and tracing\r\n- Advanced refactoring tools\r\n- Export capabilities\r\n\r\n## Note About Placeholder Content\r\n\r\nSome visualizations currently display placeholder data. In a production implementation, these would be connected to actual data from:\r\n\r\n- `dynamicalSystemsService.js`\r\n- `conceptGraphService.js`\r\n- `scholarSphereService.js`\r\n"},{"type":"text","text":"<environment_details>\n# VSCode Visible Files\nclient/src/README-WIREFRAMES.md\n\n# VSCode Open Tabs\nclient/src/components/ConceptFieldCanvas/EdgeConnection.jsx\nclient/src/components/ConceptFieldCanvas/KoopmanOverlay.jsx\nclient/src/components/ConceptFieldCanvas/ConceptFieldCanvas.jsx\nclient/src/components/FieldMeditationMode/FieldMeditationMode.jsx\nclient/src/README-WIREFRAMES.md\n\n# Current Time\n5/8/2025, 9:58:25 AM (America/Chicago, UTC-5:00)\n\n# Context Window Usage\n14,882 / 200K tokens used (7%)\n\n# Current Mode\nACT MODE\n</environment_details>"}]},{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"\nLet me explore components related to semantic version control and code change tracking.

This token-level processing limits their ability to perform abstract reasoning and handle very long, structured content‚Äãfile-czsvt95dcjytwfsnlgeqlv. Humans, by contrast, think in terms of higher-level concepts and relationships, not just word sequences‚Äãfile-vxpa6t5qu6nxmxvzn1kkvh. Two emerging approaches aim to overcome LLM limitations: Knowledge Graphs of Thoughts (KGoT)** and Large Concept Models (LCMs)**. KGoT is an AI reasoning paradigm that integrates an LLM‚Äôs chain-of-thought with an explicit knowledge graph memory, structuring intermediate ‚Äúthoughts‚Äù as nodes and edges in a graph‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. LCMs, on the other hand, are next-generation models (pioneered by Meta AI) that operate on whole concepts (e.g. sentences) rather than individual tokens‚Äãinfoq.com‚Äãfile-vxpa6t5qu6nxmxvzn1kkvh. LCMs use a language-agnostic, multimodal embedding space (Meta‚Äôs SONAR**) to represent sentences or ideas as single units, enabling the model to predict entire sentences in one step‚Äãinfoq.com.\n\nBringing together KGoT and LCMs promises to push beyond current state-of-the-art architectures (like Meta‚Äôs SONAR-based LCM) by combining structured knowledge graphs** with concept-level reasoning**. The vision is an AI that can build and navigate a persistent graph of interconnected concepts (‚Äúthoughts‚Äù) while generating and understanding ideas at a high level of abstraction. This report conducts a comprehensive and forward-looking feasibility study of implementing KGoT using LCMs. We will assess the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of this integration, critique current graph database tools (e.g. Cypher/Neo4j) for such dynamic knowledge representation, propose architectural improvements (including novel biologically inspired decoders**), and explore transformative applications across domains. Throughout, we aim to highlight bold, ambitious directions that push the boundaries** of current AI architectures, moving from token-driven text generation to concept networks with long-term reasoning and explainability.\nBackground: KGoT and LCM Foundations\nKnowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT)\n\nKGoT is an AI assistant architecture that dynamically constructs a knowledge graph** to represent the evolving state of a problem as an LLM reasons‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. Instead of relying solely on the opaque hidden state of a neural network, KGoT externalizes intermediate insights (‚Äúthoughts‚Äù) as nodes (concepts) and labeled edges (relations) in a graph‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. Each thought generated by the LLM updates the graph ‚Äì adding new entities, relations, or attributes ‚Äì so that the knowledge graph grows and adapts as reasoning progresses‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. This structured representation can be queried or used by the model to decide next steps, creating a feedback loop between the LLM and the knowledge graph‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. For example, in a complex question-answering task, a KGoT system might create nodes for key concepts in the question, link them (subject‚Äìpredicate‚Äìobject triples), and continually refine this graph by calling tools (web search, calculators, etc.) to fill in missing pieces‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. The final answer is derived from the graph‚Äôs information. Crucially, the graph serves as an external dynamic memory**, allowing the system to handle more complex multi-step queries with fewer hallucinations. Empirical results support KGoT‚Äôs effectiveness: Besta et al. (2025) report that a KGoT-based assistant achieved 29% higher task success** on challenging GAIA benchmark tasks than a standard GPT-4 agent, all while using a much smaller LLM (GPT-4o mini) and reducing API call costs by over 36√ó‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. This illustrates the strength of structured knowledge integration ‚Äì even a weaker model can outperform a strong LLM when armed with a relevant knowledge graph. KGoT offers a path to scalable, low-cost reasoning** by leveraging structured knowledge to compensate for smaller model sizes‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu.\nLarge Concept Models (LCMs)\n\nLarge Concept Models represent a paradigm shift in language modeling from token-level to concept-level generation**‚Äãinfoq.com‚Äãfile-czsvt95dcjytwfsnlgeqlv. In Meta‚Äôs implementation, an LCM ingests text (or speech) and encodes entire sentences or semantic units into a single embedding in a fixed-size latent space called SONAR**‚Äãinfoq.com. SONAR is a multilingual, multimodal sentence embedding space covering 200 written languages and 76 spoken languages‚Äãinfoq.com. It was trained with an encoder‚Äìdecoder architecture that compresses a sentence‚Äôs meaning into a vector (via a bottleneck) and can decode back to any language or modality without needing the original text‚Äãfile-vxpa6t5qu6nxmxvzn1kkvh‚Äãfile-vxpa6t5qu6nxmxvzn1kkvh. An LCM is essentially a transformer that operates on sequences of these concept embeddings, predicting the next concept (sentence embedding) autoregressively‚Äãinfoq.com. Because each step generates an entire thought or sentence, LCMs can model abstract and hierarchical reasoning more naturally ‚Äì they mirror how humans first think in ideas or sentences, then articulate words‚Äãfile-vxpa6t5qu6nxmxvzn1kkvh. LCMs also cope better with long content: by chunking text into concepts, they implicitly handle longer contexts (e.g. paragraphs) with fewer steps. In fact, a 7B-parameter LCM outperformed a comparable 8B Llama 3.1 model on a long-form summarization benchmark (XLSum) in zero-shot tests‚Äãinfoq.com, demonstrating improved coherence on extended inputs. Moreover, LCM outputs can be decoded into any supported language or even speech, enabling truly language-agnostic understanding and generation‚Äãinfoq.com‚Äãinfoq.com. This flexibility suggests LCMs can transfer knowledge across languages and modalities seamlessly ‚Äì a transferability** advantage. Meta‚Äôs early results show promise, and they frame LCMs as ‚Äúa step towards increasing scientific diversity‚Äù in language model design‚Äãinfoq.com. However, current LCMs still trail state-of-the-art LLMs** in raw performance and will require significant architectural improvements, better training data, and scaling beyond 70B parameters to realize their full potential‚Äãinfoq.com. This underlines an opportunity: by enhancing LCM architectures (for example, with new decoder designs or integrated knowledge graphs), we could unlock powerful new capabilities beyond what token-based LLMs or initial LCM versions like SONAR can achieve.\nSWOT Analysis: Integrating KGoT with LCMs\n\nCombining KGoT‚Äôs dynamic knowledge graphs with LCMs‚Äô concept-level reasoning yields a system that is more than the sum of its parts. Below, we analyze the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT)** of this integration:\nStrengths\n\n- \n\nStructured Reasoning with High-Level Concepts** ‚Äì The synergy of KGoT and LCMs marries two complementary strengths: explicit structured knowledge and abstract reasoning. LCMs provide the ability to reason in terms of whole ideas (concept embeddings) rather than getting lost in token-level detail‚Äãfile-vxpa6t5qu6nxmxvzn1kkvh. KGoT provides a graph memory to store and relate those ideas in a coherent structure‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. Together, an LCM+KGoT system can break a complex problem into discrete conceptual steps and record each step in a knowledge graph. This leads to more systematic problem solving** (the graph acts like a scratchpad) and better handling of tasks requiring multi-step logical decomposition. Empirically, structured representations have enabled smaller models to solve harder tasks with higher success rates‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu, so we expect a concept-infused graph will similarly boost reasoning quality and reliability.\n\n- \n\nEnhanced Memory and Context** ‚Äì A major strength of adding a Knowledge Graph of Thoughts is extended memory** beyond the LCM‚Äôs fixed context window. Even though LCMs can cover more context than token LLMs by using sentence embeddings, they are still essentially sequence models with finite length. By contrast, a knowledge graph can persist information throughout a session (or across sessions), accumulating facts and intermediate results without forgetting them. The LCM can query or attend to this graph for relevant information instead of trying to pack everything into its sequence of concepts. This dynamic memory addresses long-term dependencies: for instance, a personal assistant could remember a user‚Äôs preferences or earlier queries in a graph, enabling long-lived dialogues or plans spanning many interactions. The graph structure also naturally encodes context non-linearly** ‚Äì unlike a single sequence, it can branch and reorganize information. This means an LCM+KGoT agent could handle real-time updates and changing goals by simply adding or re-arranging nodes in the graph, rather than re-encoding an entirely new sequence from scratch. Overall, the integration provides memory that grows with the task**, crucial for long-form reasoning and complex problem solving.\n\n- \n\nMultimodal and Cross-Domain Integration** ‚Äì LCMs (via SONAR) are inherently multilingual and multimodal‚Äãinfoq.com, which means the concept representations in the knowledge graph need not be just text. Nodes in a KGoT could represent an image (encoded as a concept vector), a piece of audio, or text in various languages ‚Äì all mapped into the shared concept space. This opens the door for truly multimodal knowledge graphs where, say, an image‚Äôs description, a spoken commentary, and a written Wikipedia article about a concept all link to the same node. An LCM can generate and interpret these cross-domain concepts fluidly, allowing transfer of knowledge between modalities and languages**. For example, the system could take a problem described in English, retrieve a relevant diagram image, and incorporate facts from a Chinese article ‚Äì all integrated in one graph of concepts. This transferability across domains is a key strength for building AI assistants that operate in rich, real-world environments. Additionally, concept-based graphs make it easier to integrate domain-specific knowledge: one could plug in scientific databases or ontologies as subgraphs (since those are often concept-oriented), giving the LCM immediate structured knowledge in fields like medicine or engineering.\n\n- \n\nExplainability and Traceability** ‚Äì By design, KGoT produces an interpretable trace** of the AI‚Äôs reasoning: the knowledge graph itself. Each edge and node can be inspected to understand what facts or assumptions the model made at each step. Combining this with concept-level reasoning enhances explainability. The LCM operates on meaningful units (sentences/ideas), which can be decoded into human-readable language at any point‚Äãfile-vxpa6t5qu6nxmxvzn1kkvh‚Äãfile-vxpa6t5qu6nxmxvzn1kkvh. Thus, as the LCM works through a task, one could decode its intermediate concept representations and examine the knowledge graph to follow the ‚Äútrain of thought.‚Äù This is far more transparent than latent token embeddings in a black-box LLM. In domains like healthcare or law where justification is critical, an LCM+KGoT system could output not just an answer but a concept map showing supporting evidence and reasoning paths (akin to a concept-level explanation). Researchers note that LCMs can present outputs as structured summaries or concept maps** to make model decisions more understandable‚Äãfile-czsvt95dcjytwfsnlgeqlv. The graph of thoughts provides exactly that: a persistent semantic map** of the reasoning process, improving user trust and the ability to audit or debug the AI‚Äôs behavior.\n\n- \n\nEfficiency via External Knowledge** ‚Äì Storing facts in a graph and using smaller concept predictions can make reasoning more resource-efficient. KGoT has already shown large cost reductions by using an external knowledge graph instead of expensive LLM calls for every sub-step‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. In an LCM context, focusing on concept-level generation means fewer generation steps for a given amount of information (a single concept might encapsulate 10+ tokens worth of knowledge). This can accelerate inference and reduce computational load. Moreover, if the knowledge graph contains facts that do not need re-generating, the model can simply fetch those rather than redundantly encoding them in context. The result is a form of modular computation**: the graph handles storage and simple lookup, while the LCM handles reasoning and generation. This division of labor could make the system more scalable and cost-efficient, especially for deployments as AI assistants where many queries deal with recurring knowledge that can be cached in the graph.\n\nWeaknesses\n\n- \n\nSystem Complexity** ‚Äì Integrating a knowledge graph with a concept-model drastically increases system complexity. Instead of a single neural model, we now have multiple components: the LCM, a graph database or in-memory graph engine, interfaces between the two, and possibly external tools (for retrieving information). Coordinating these in real-time is non-trivial. The LCM needs a mechanism to decide when to query or update the graph, how to encode graph information back into concept embeddings, and how to handle inconsistencies. The orchestration logic (controller) can be complex and hard to optimize. Each component (especially the graph) introduces potential failure modes. For instance, the LCM might generate an incorrect graph query, or the graph might not update fast enough to keep up with the model. This complexity can lead to brittleness. In early KGoT experiments, many failures occurred not due to lack of knowledge, but due to the LLM formatting a Cypher query incorrectly‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. More components also mean more engineering effort and tuning is required to get the system working optimally.\n\n- \n\nMaturity and Performance of LCMs** ‚Äì As of 2025, LCMs are a very new technology. Their performance, while promising, does not yet match the raw language fluency of the best LLMs‚Äãinfoq.com. For instance, a 7B LCM can outperform a similar LLM on some tasks like summarization‚Äãinfoq.com, but on general knowledge Q&amp;A or coding, the concept-based approach might still lag because it‚Äôs essentially compressing information (the bottleneck could lose nuance). Relying on LCMs means accepting these current limitations: the integrated system might struggle with fine-grained linguistic outputs or creative generation until LCMs are further advanced. There is also limited tooling and community knowledge around LCM development compared to the rich ecosystem for LLMs. Training or fine-tuning an LCM with KGoT might require custom pipelines (e.g. to supply concept sequences and graphs as training data), for which existing frameworks are immature. In short, adopting LCMs early comes with performance and development risks**, and one must carefully evaluate if the concept-level benefits outweigh the areas where LLMs excel (for example, writing eloquent prose might be harder when generating one sentence at a time in isolation).\n\n- \n\nAlignment and Interface Challenges** ‚Äì Bridging the gap between a symbolic_ knowledge graph and neural_ concept embeddings is an open challenge. The knowledge graph uses discrete symbols (nodes with labels, relations) whereas the LCM uses dense vectors in the SONAR space to represent meaning. Mapping one to the other is not straightforward. If a concept node in the graph corresponds to a sentence embedding, one needs a way to retrieve that embedding (perhaps by running the sentence through the SONAR encoder) and feed it to the LCM. Conversely, when the LCM produces a new concept (vector), it must be decoded (via SONAR decoder) into text to add as a node or relation in the graph‚Äãfile-vxpa6t5qu6nxmxvzn1kkvh. Any slight error in this decode-encode cycle could introduce inconsistencies (e.g., the model‚Äôs concept might not exactly match a node label). There‚Äôs also the issue of semantic granularity mismatch**: the LCM‚Äôs concept might encapsulate a complex idea that doesn‚Äôt directly translate to a single graph node or edge. For example, an LCM concept embedding might represent ‚Äúthe cat is on the mat‚Äù, which in a KG would be two entities connected by a relation. We might need to split one concept into multiple graph entries. Designing the interface such that the graph and the LCM stay semantically in sync is challenging. Without careful design, the graph could become out-of-date or irrelevant to the LCM‚Äôs current context (stale knowledge), or the LCM could generate concepts that don‚Äôt cleanly integrate into the graph structure.\n\n- \n\nReal-Time and Scalability Constraints** ‚Äì While a knowledge graph provides extended memory, updating and querying it in real-time can become a bottleneck. Traditional graph databases like Neo4j are optimized for persistent storage, not for dozens of updates per second from a running language model. In the initial KGoT implementation, Neo4j was used and was not the main bottleneck‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu, but that was with a relatively small graph per task. As we scale up, latency could grow: each Cypher query might take tens of milliseconds, which slows down an LCM that otherwise could generate concepts in parallel on a GPU. Even if we use an in-memory graph (like NetworkX in Python), Python‚Äôs speed becomes a factor. Researchers observed that NetworkX (Python) could be faster than Neo4j for small graphs (avoiding DB overhead)‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu, but as graph size grows, Python may slow down. There is a weakness in current tooling here: we lack a high-performance, parallel graph memory_ that seamlessly integrates with the neural model. Also, memory usage could explode if the graph isn‚Äôt managed ‚Äî a long-running assistant might accumulate thousands of nodes and edges, raising issues of how to prune or compress the knowledge without forgetting important details. Semantic scaling** is problematic: as the knowledge graph grows, finding the relevant subgraph for a given query or context becomes harder (it‚Äôs like finding a needle in a growing haystack). Without advanced retrieval (e.g. embedding-based search on node content), the system could bog down trying to traverse huge graphs. These scalability issues mean the approach might currently be better suited for smaller-scale or specialized tasks unless significant infrastructure improvements are made.\n\n- \n\nPotential for Error Accumulation** ‚Äì An often overlooked weakness is the risk of compounding errors** in an iterative reasoning loop. When an LLM works alone, an error in reasoning might lead to a wrong answer, but the session ends. In an LCM+KGoT loop, a mistake (for example, adding a wrong edge to the graph or misinterpreting a concept) can persist in the knowledge graph and taint subsequent steps. If not identified, the graph could accumulate incorrect or irrelevant information. This is analogous to a human with a faulty memory ‚Äì once a false fact is recorded, all future reasoning might build on it. While the graph offers transparency to detect such errors, it also means the system must have robust self-correction** or validation mechanisms. Otherwise, an early hallucination could propagate through the graph and mislead later concept generations. Managing and curating the knowledge in the graph (perhaps by weighting confidence or attaching evidence to each node) is necessary to mitigate this, but current KGoT prototypes rely on the LLM to fix its own mistakes‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. That process (like the LLM debugging its Cypher or Python code) has had some success‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu, but it‚Äôs not infallible. In summary, without careful safeguards, the interplay of a neural model and a symbolic memory could lead to stability issues** in the reasoning process.\n\nOpportunities\n\n- \n\nNew Emergent Capabilities** ‚Äì The integration of concept-level modeling with a graph memory is likely to unlock capabilities that neither approach achieves alone. One exciting opportunity is analogical reasoning and cross-domain insight**. With a knowledge graph mapping out relationships, an LCM could more easily find structural similarities between disparate problems. For example, it might notice that the pattern of nodes in a medical diagnosis graph resembles the pattern in an engineering problem graph, suggesting an analogy. This is akin to the model having a conceptual network** of knowledge where creative leaps can emerge by traversing the graph in non-obvious ways. Such network-driven analogies are a hallmark of human creativity and scientific discovery. Indeed, researchers envision LCMs being used to map concepts across fields and generate cross-domain hypotheses‚Äãfile-czsvt95dcjytwfsnlgeqlv ‚Äì a capability critical for innovation. By encoding knowledge as graphs, we provide the scaffolding for an AI to perform combinatorial generalization**, assembling known concepts into novel configurations to solve new problems (like a chemist combining known compounds to create a new one). This could be the key to more general problem-solving AI.\n\n- \n\nCognitive Modeling and Human-AI Synergy** ‚Äì The KGoT+LCM paradigm presents an opportunity to model human-like cognition more faithfully in AI systems. Cognitive scientists often represent human knowledge as semantic networks (graphs) and believe that thought involves high-level conceptual chunks and their interactions. Our system explicitly mirrors this: it has a network of concepts and uses them for reasoning. This could make the AI‚Äôs thought process more relatable to human experts or psychologists. For instance, one could use an LCM+KGoT to simulate how a human might reason through a complex scenario, step by step, and compare the ‚Äúthought graph‚Äù to human concept maps. In education or training, such a system could explain its reasoning to users in concept-by-concept form, potentially making it a better tutor. Interdisciplinary research** is another opportunity ‚Äì the system could serve as a platform for collaboration between AI researchers and cognitive scientists, using the graph-of-thoughts as a common language to discuss how ideas propagate and connect‚Äãfile-czsvt95dcjytwfsnlgeqlv. Moreover, by studying the graphs the AI produces, we might gain insights into emergent thinking patterns, biases, or solution strategies, leading to better alignment with human values and reasoning styles.\n\n- \n\nReal-Time Reasoning and Adaptation** ‚Äì As AI assistants move into settings like robotics, finance, or continuous dialogue, the ability to perform real-time reasoning** with streaming data is crucial. A combined concept model with a knowledge graph is well suited to this. The knowledge graph can be continually updated with new incoming information (sensor readings, live chat messages, etc.), and the LCM can reason over this evolving graph on the fly. The opportunity here is to build AI that doesn‚Äôt just react with pre-trained knowledge, but that can learn and adapt in the moment**. For example, consider an AI monitoring a complex system (like an IT network or a spacecraft): it could use a graph to track the state of different components and anomalies, and an LCM to conceptually reason about possible causes or fixes. As new alerts come in, they become new nodes/edges in the graph, and the reasoning adapts. This goes beyond current static context windows. Integration with KGoT has been noted to improve real-time data analysis and decision-making efficiency‚Äãlink.springer.com. In domains like emergency response or financial trading, where conditions change rapidly, such an AI could maintain situational awareness over long durations, continuously updating its ‚Äúknowledge base‚Äù and making decisions that consider both historical context and immediate inputs.\n\n- \n\nAdvances in Explainable and Trustworthy AI** ‚Äì There is a strong demand for AI systems whose decisions can be explained and justified, especially in regulated industries. An LCM+KGoT system inherently produces explanations in the form of its knowledge graph and concept trail. We have the opportunity to push this further: the system could be designed to output structured justifications** for each answer, drawn from the graph. Because the graph‚Äôs nodes could be linked to sources (e.g. a node might have an attribute with a citation or a tool result), the AI‚Äôs answers could come with footnotes or references to supporting data ‚Äì effectively a built-in ‚Äúshow your work.‚Äù This level of transparency would be a leap forward in making AI trustworthy. Additionally, the structured nature of concept graphs might make it easier to enforce ethical and safety constraints. For instance, one could imagine running graph algorithms on the knowledge graph to detect undesirable reasoning paths (like those leading to biased or harmful conclusions) and pruning them or alerting a human overseer. The AI‚Äôs internal graph could be inspected for bias (are all its facts coming from one source? Is it missing counterpoints?) and adjusted as needed, which is much harder to do with end-to-end neural networks. As noted in recent literature, LCMs enabling outputs as concept maps can enhance transparency and help ensure outputs adhere to ethical guidelines‚Äãfile-czsvt95dcjytwfsnlgeqlv. This integration could thus accelerate progress in Explainable AI (XAI)** by providing clear, concept-level rationales rather than justifications hidden in billions of weights.\n\n- \n\nDomain Specialization and Transfer Learning** ‚Äì Another opportunity is the ease of injecting domain-specific knowledge and then transferring learning to new domains. With a knowledge graph, one can encode a large amount of expert knowledge (say, a medical ontology or legal statutes) as an initial graph. The LCM can be initialized with general concept understanding (trained on broad data via SONAR embeddings), and then specialized_ by allowing it to ingest and reason with the domain graph. This is potentially more data-efficient than fine-tuning a huge LLM on domain text, because the knowledge is given in a structured form. At the same time, because the LCM‚Äôs concept space is general and language-agnostic, the system can still operate outside that domain when needed. It could, for example, take a concept it learned in finance and find an analogy in economics or politics by mapping the graph structures. Researchers have suggested creating specialized conceptual models** for domains like legal or medical text‚Äãfile-czsvt95dcjytwfsnlgeqlv; KGoT would complement that by providing a repository for domain knowledge that the conceptual model can query. The combination enables a flexible kind of transfer learning: the graph serves as a medium to transfer knowledge into and out of the model. When moving to a new domain, one could carry over portions of the graph (e.g. general common sense subgraphs) to bootstrap the model‚Äôs understanding. This modular transfer of knowledge is much harder with end-to-end networks that entangle knowledge implicitly. Hence, the KGoT+LCM approach could lead to AI that is both highly specialized** (via its graph content) and broadly capable** (via its general concept reasoning skills), simply by swapping in/out different knowledge subgraphs.\n\nThreats\n\n- \n\nCompetition from End-to-End Models** ‚Äì A strategic threat to the KGoT+LCM approach is the rapid advance of end-to-end LLMs and related architectures. If future ultra-large models (or improved LCMs without graphs) manage to handle long contexts and perform reasoning through implicit knowledge encoding, the relative advantage of adding a graph might diminish. For example, if an LLM with 1 trillion parameters and retrieval augmentation can answer extremely complex queries with no external graph, users and developers may prefer the simpler route. The concept of explicitly maintaining a knowledge graph might then be seen as an unnecessary complication except for niche cases. We already see some skepticism in the community ‚Äì some argue that trying to explicitly structure thoughts could be revisiting old symbolic AI ideas that were surpassed by end-to-end learning (‚Äúfeels like a failure to learn the bitter lesson‚Äù one observer said of LCMs‚Äãinfoq.com). This sentiment reflects the risk that if KGoT+LCM does not quickly demonstrate clear wins (in accuracy, efficiency or new capabilities), effort could shift back to purely neural approaches. Essentially, the threat is being leapfrogged by simpler or more data-driven architectures** that achieve similar results without the knowledge graph overhead.\n\n- \n\nIntegration Complexity and Reliability** ‚Äì The complexity of the integrated system, noted as a weakness, can also manifest as a threat in real-world adoption. An AI system that is hard to robustly implement or scale might fail to gain traction commercially. If the KGoT+LCM system has many points of failure (graph database crashes, synchronization bugs between the LCM and KG, etc.), it could be seen as unreliable for mission-critical applications. Moreover, maintaining such a system (keeping the KG consistent with model updates, ensuring security of the data in the graph, etc.) could pose operational challenges. For instance, if used as a personal assistant, the knowledge graph will contain potentially sensitive user data ‚Äì protecting and managing that data is an added burden compared to stateless LLM services. Security** is a concern: an attacker might attempt to inject malicious nodes or manipulate the graph (‚Äúprompt injection‚Äù could evolve into ‚Äúgraph injection‚Äù attacks). If these risks aren‚Äôt mitigated, users may distrust the system or prefer closed models. Thus, the intricate nature of the system threatens its practical deployability** and trustworthiness if not handled with great care.\n\n- \n\nScalability and Maintenance Costs** ‚Äì While using external knowledge can save on inference costs, maintaining a large-scale knowledge graph of thoughts could incur its own costs. Storing and updating a huge graph (potentially millions of nodes if an assistant runs for long and across many users) requires database resources. There‚Äôs a threat that the infrastructure cost and complexity of the KG erode the savings from using a smaller LCM. Additionally, the graph might need periodic cleaning, merging of duplicate nodes, and other maintenance ‚Äì tasks that could require offline processing or human curation. If these costs mount, the approach might be less appealing than it appears in research demos. Scalability is also a threat in terms of performance degradation**: as noted, the approach must overcome computational constraints to work in real-time. If those constraints aren‚Äôt solved (through better algorithms or hardware acceleration for graph operations), the system might not scale to large user bases or complex tasks. Imagine a scenario where many parallel instances of KGoT+LCM are needed (e.g. AI assistants for thousands of users) ‚Äì scaling the graph databases and coordinating with LCM instances could become a serious bottleneck, threatening the viability in production scenarios.\n\n- \n\nKnowledge Graph Quality and Evolution** ‚Äì The usefulness of a KGoT system is only as good as the knowledge graph it builds. A threat is that the knowledge graphs constructed by an autonomous agent might degrade in quality over time or diverge from factual truth. Unlike a static knowledge base curated by experts, an AI-generated_ knowledge graph could slowly accumulate errors, irrelevant trivia, or even subtle biases based on the model‚Äôs outputs. If the graph isn‚Äôt periodically validated or refreshed, the system might start making decisions on outdated or false information. This is somewhat analogous to ‚Äúconcept drift‚Äù in AI, but in the knowledge graph context. Particularly for open-domain personal assistants, the graph might pick up user rumors, personal beliefs, or other non-generalizable data that then influence the model‚Äôs answers globally. Managing the evolution of the knowledge graph** is thus critical. Without good solutions, this threat could manifest as the AI‚Äôs performance actually worsening_ over time or locking onto incorrect world models. Ensuring the graph stays accurate and relevant (perhaps by linking it to verified external KGs like Wikidata, or by periodic retraining) is necessary to avoid this issue. The threat is that if not handled, the KGoT approach could lead to a tangled, erroneous knowledge base that undermines trust and correctness in the long run.\n\n- \n\nEthical and Social Concerns** ‚Äì Finally, pushing AI to have persistent knowledge and long-term reasoning raises new ethical considerations. A system that retains a graph of a user‚Äôs thoughts and interactions could violate privacy if misused. There is also the question of how such powerful reasoning systems might be controlled ‚Äì an AI that can generate complex plans and hold a wealth of knowledge might be misapplied for harmful purposes (planning nefarious activities, for example). While these concerns are not unique to KGoT+LCM, the addition of a structured memory means the AI can potentially store and recall information indefinitely**, which might conflict with policies like data minimization or the ‚Äúright to be forgotten.‚Äù If not addressed, regulatory pushback or public concern could threaten the adoption of such systems. On the flip side, the explainability of KGoT could alleviate some concerns, but it‚Äôs a double-edged sword: an explainable chain of thought might reveal biases or controversial intermediate conclusions that a more opaque model would hide. Society will closely scrutinize an AI that essentially ‚Äúthinks out loud‚Äù in graph form, and any problematic reasoning could cause backlash. Therefore, developers of these systems must be proactive in embedding ethical guidelines and monitors into the architecture to prevent misuse or unintended negative consequences.\n\nLimitations of Current Graph Implementation Tools\n\nAn important practical aspect of building a KGoT system is the choice of technology for implementing the knowledge graph. Early implementations have used graph databases like Neo4j** with the Cypher query language‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu, as well as in-memory graph libraries like NetworkX‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. While these tools are powerful for traditional knowledge graphs, they encounter limitations when serving as the dynamic ‚Äúmemory‚Äù for a live AI reasoning process. Key limitations include:\n\n- \n\nDynamic Memory Overhead:** Traditional graph databases (e.g. Neo4j) are optimized for persistent storage and complex queries, not for rapid, continuous updates by an AI. In a KGoT scenario, the graph is essentially a working memory ‚Äì nodes and edges are being added or modified with each thought. Neo4j requires each update to be a transaction, which introduces overhead and latency‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. Even if each individual transaction is fast, the cumulative cost of many small updates can slow down throughput. In contrast, an in-memory structure (like a Python NetworkX graph) can update more directly without network/database I/O. Researchers found that using NetworkX eliminated the need for a separate database server and avoided transaction overhead, making it a more lightweight choice for frequent updates**‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. However, Python-based solutions have their own scaling issues and are not thread-safe for parallel access. The ideal solution (likely a custom in-memory graph store in C++ or on GPU) is not yet standard. In summary, current tools either incur overhead in dynamic use (Neo4j) or lack robustness and speed at scale (NetworkX), indicating a need for new graph memory engines optimized for AI thought graphs.\n\n- \n\nSemantic Scaling and Query Complexity:** Cypher, the query language for Neo4j, is designed for relatively structured queries on known schema (e.g. finding patterns in a social network). In a dynamically growing knowledge graph of thoughts, the structure is ad-hoc and can become quite complex (mixing many types of entities and relations). Composing correct Cypher queries on the fly is hard ‚Äì the LLM has to generate these queries, and as observed, it often struggles with complex graphs‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. The more the graph scales in size and complexity (semantic richness), the more chance the model will produce a wrong or suboptimal query. For example, if the graph has hundreds of nodes, writing a Cypher query to retrieve a multi-hop relation chain requires precise syntax that an LLM might fumble. The KGoT experiments noted that as graphs grew, Cypher queries became difficult to generate correctly‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu, and the LLM was actually more successful writing imperative Python code to traverse the graph (which it could more easily debug)‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. This points to a limitation in current graph query paradigms for fuzzy, evolving semantics_. Also, Cypher retrieves exact matches unless you explicitly use full-text search or similar; it‚Äôs not built to find, say, ‚Äúa node approximately similar to concept X‚Äù unless you add extensions. Semantic scaling here means handling more abstract or inexact queries, something current systems don‚Äôt handle gracefully out-of-the-box.\n\n- \n\nSymbolic‚ÄìConceptual Interface:** Standard graph databases treat node and edge labels as symbols (strings, IDs) with no notion of vector embeddings or semantic similarity. But in a concept-based system, we may want to store or index nodes by their concept embedding (from SONAR) to quickly find which stored concept is most similar to a new one, or to do vector searches. Neo4j recently has plugins for vector search, but it‚Äôs not a native capability. This impedance mismatch** means we often end up storing text in the graph and using the LCM to embed and compare concepts separately. There is no built-in way for Neo4j to, for example, take an embedding and return the nearest neighbor nodes. We have to either approximate by storing keywords or maintain a separate vector index. This complicates the integration: the LCM might produce a concept embedding for ‚ÄúX‚Äù, and we want to find if the graph has something similar, but we can‚Äôt do that purely in Cypher. We might need to iterate over nodes and compute cosine similarities externally, which is slow for large graphs. So, the interface between the continuous_ vector world of LCMs and the discrete_ world of graph DBs is clunky with current tech. This is a limitation that calls for either new graph databases that natively support hybrid symbolic‚Äìvector queries, or a tighter coupling of the model and the graph (like storing the graph in the model‚Äôs own memory ‚Äì e.g. as a knowledge-attention mechanism).\n\n- \n\nComputational Constraints:** Even ignoring the database vs. memory issue, graph algorithms themselves can become a bottleneck. A knowledge graph of thoughts doesn‚Äôt just sit there; we might want to run algorithms on it (e.g. shortest path to connect two concepts, or centrality to find key facts, etc.). In a complex reasoning process, the agent could conceivably benefit from graph algorithms as tools. However, many graph algorithms are NP-hard or linear in nodes+edges**, which could be too slow if invoked frequently on a big graph. Additionally, if the graph grows large, just the memory footprint and traversal cost in Python or Java (for Neo4j) becomes heavy. These computational issues mean that without constraints or clever management, a KGoT system could grind to a halt on complex tasks due to graph processing alone. The KGoT research found that a direct ‚Äúdump the whole graph to context‚Äù approach (Direct Retrieval) sometimes outperformed structured queries‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu ‚Äì essentially bypassing computation and letting the LLM read everything ‚Äì but that has its own limit (context size). It highlights that when structured querying fails or is slow, the system may fall back to brute-force inclusion of graph content‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu, which is not scalable. Computational constraints thus push us to improve graph query success rates and efficiency. If we stick with off-the-shelf tools like Neo4j, we might mitigate some issues (they are optimized in C++ and can handle quite large graphs on good hardware), but the integration overhead and lack of concept-awareness remain. In essence, current graph systems are not tailored to be the transient working memory** of an AI‚Äôs mind; they are built for static or slowly changing knowledge bases. Overcoming this will likely require custom solutions or significant adaptation of existing ones.\n\nArchitectural Improvements for Next-Generation LCMs\n\nTo fully realize the potential of LCMs combined with KGoT, we need to go beyond the ‚Äústandard decoder-only Transformer‚Äù that current LCM implementations use‚Äãinfoq.com. Below we propose several architectural improvements and novel components that could make next-generation LCMs more powerful in building and leveraging knowledge graphs of thoughts. These improvements draw inspiration from neuroscience and complex systems, aiming to create more dynamic, persistent, and structured concept-processing models**:\n\n Figure: Conceptual diagram of a geodesic-aware oscillator decoder** for an LCM. The decoder is envisioned as a dynamical system where each decoding step is guided by an internal oscillatory cycle (illustrated by the sinusoidal curves). The oscillation creates rhythmic ‚Äúwindows‚Äù (shaded regions) during which the model can effectively attend to or update the knowledge graph memory. Meanwhile, the decoder is geodesic-aware**: it understands the geometric structure of the concept embedding space (depicted as a curved manifold) and generates successive concept embeddings along smooth paths (geodesics) on this manifold. Such a decoder could maintain long-term coherence by revisiting prior concepts at regular intervals (synchronization points) and ensuring that new concepts are reached via minimal transitions (shortest paths) in semantic space. This biologically inspired design aims to stabilize long chains of thought and align the model‚Äôs internal rhythm with the logical structure of reasoning._\n\n- \n\nGeodesic-Aware Oscillator Decoder:** One radical idea is to redesign the LCM‚Äôs decoder as a dynamical system with oscillatory components** rather than a strictly feed-forward transformer. In the brain, oscillatory rhythms (theta, alpha waves, etc.) are believed to play a role in segmenting and coordinating thoughts and memories. We can take inspiration from this by introducing an oscillator mechanism into the decoder that creates a repeating cycle for context updates. Concretely, imagine the decoder has an internal clock that splits the generation process into phases ‚Äì for example, a ‚Äúretrieve‚Äù phase and a ‚Äúwrite‚Äù phase, repeating periodically. During the retrieve phase (say when the oscillation peaks), the decoder could query the knowledge graph or refresh its working memory, and during the trough it generates new content. This rhythmic approach may help with long-term consistency**, as it periodically re-aligns with the stored context instead of drifting. At the same time, making the decoder geodesic-aware** means incorporating knowledge of the concept space geometry. If the SONAR embedding space is seen as a manifold where distance correlates with semantic difference, the decoder could be constrained (or trained) to move along efficient paths on this manifold. Instead of jumping erratically between unrelated concepts, it would traverse smoothly ‚Äì analogous to how a story naturally flows from one idea to a related next idea. Technically, this could be encouraged by adding a loss term that penalizes changes in direction in embedding space that are too large (thus encouraging minimal geodesic distance between successive concept embeddings). The combination ‚Äì an oscillator ensuring periodic context reconnection, and geodesic guidance ensuring semantic smoothness ‚Äì could tackle a known challenge: maintaining coherence over many steps. By rhythmically anchoring to past concepts (perhaps re-reading the graph or previous embeddings every N steps) and taking the shortest semantic path forward, the model can generate a long sequence of thoughts without losing the thread. Such a decoder might be implemented with recurrent elements or continuous-time neural networks that inherently oscillate (like a Hopfield network or a sinusoidal recurrent unit), layered on top of the transformer blocks. While this is a departure from standard architectures, it aligns with the idea that biologically-inspired timing mechanisms** could give AI a form of working memory and attention management akin to a brain‚Äôs prefrontal cortex.\n\n- \n\nGraph-Integrated Attention Mechanisms:** Current LCMs attend only to the sequence of concepts given to them. We can enhance this by allowing the model to directly attend to nodes and edges of the knowledge graph**. One way is to develop a Graph-Attention Head_ that takes the current concept embedding and retrieves connected node embeddings from the KG (perhaps via a learned projection or a small GNN module) and then integrates that into the transformer‚Äôs context. Another approach is to encode the knowledge graph as a set of triplet embeddings and include those in the self-attention alongside the sequence. Essentially, the decoder would have access to not just a sequence of past concepts, but also a set of key‚Äìvalue pairs derived from the graph (like a memory matrix). For example, if the current concept is C, and in the graph C is linked to D and E, the model‚Äôs attention heads could pull in information from D and E‚Äôs embeddings when predicting the next concept. This graph-aware attention_ could be implemented by augmenting the transformer with an adjacency matrix-based bias: if concept_i and concept_j are connected in the KG, then the attention mechanism could increase the weight of j when attending from i. This way, the structure of the knowledge graph guides the flow of information inside the model. This improvement would tightly couple the KG with the model‚Äôs internal state, moving towards a neuro-symbolic hybrid** where the graph influences neural computation in real-time. Such architectural integration means the model might not even need to explicitly query the graph via Cypher; instead, it ‚Äúnatively‚Äù knows how to use the graph connections to inform its predictions.\n\n- \n\nPersistent Concept Memory (Long-term)**: To enable long-term reasoning**, we propose equipping LCMs with a form of persistent memory_ that outlasts a single inference run. Rather than treating each query or task independently, the model could have a memory store (concept embeddings + graph) that it updates over time. One implementation might be a specialized memory encoder/decoder** pair that is part of the architecture: after the main decoder generates outputs or reaches a stopping point, a memory update module writes salient new concepts or relations into a memory matrix (which could be seen as an implicit graph). For example, if the model just solved a problem and the KG now has 10 new nodes that were crucial, the memory encoder could compress those into a few concept embeddings and store them in a slot in a memory bank. Next time, when a related task comes, a memory decoder could retrieve and expand those embeddings to re-initialize the knowledge graph or provide additional context. This is analogous to how experiences form memories that later inform future decisions. In essence, the LCM would learn to build its own semantic map of knowledge** across sessions. This could be facilitated by training the model on sequences of related problems so that it learns to retain and reuse information. Technically, it might draw on ideas from episodic memory networks** or continual learning, with mechanisms to avoid catastrophic forgetting. A concrete approach could be to maintain a running knowledge graph (for a user or domain) in vector form and periodically fine-tune or prompt the LCM with it. The architectural innovation here would be ensuring the model allocates dedicated capacity to remembering past concept graphs, separate from its short-term context. This persistent memory is what would allow KGoT to really enable lifelong learning** in an AI assistant, where the assistant gets smarter and more knowledgeable with each interaction, not resetting to a blank slate every time.\n\n- \n\nHyper-dimensional and Hyperbolic Embeddings:** Current SONAR embeddings are Euclidean. However, knowledge graphs, especially those representing hierarchical or multi-relational data, might be better served by non-Euclidean embeddings** (like hyperbolic space for hierarchies, or higher-dimensional spaces for packing more information). Future LCMs could incorporate alternative embedding spaces that reflect the structure of knowledge better. For instance, a hyperbolic embedding space naturally represents tree-like structures (many KGs have taxonomic hierarchies) with low distortion. If the LCM‚Äôs concept space were hyperbolic, the ‚Äúgeodesic-aware‚Äù part of the decoder becomes particularly meaningful, as geodesics in hyperbolic space correspond to logical inferences along a hierarchy. Alternatively, one could use tensor embeddings** that carry more information (imagine each concept represented by a set of vectors or a matrix, encoding different facets). The model‚Äôs decoder might then choose which facet to focus on when generating the next concept. These enhancements in representation go hand in hand with architecture: the model might need modified layers (e.g., hyperbolic neural network layers that respect the hyperbolic geometry). The payoff would be a richer, more faithful modeling of conceptual relationships, improving the interface with the knowledge graph (since the KG‚Äôs structure could be mirrored in the embedding geometry). In summary, exploring geometric and dimensionality innovations_ could significantly improve how well the LCM captures the intricacies of a knowledge graph in its latent space, making reasoning steps more natural.\n\n- \n\nTraining Regimes for Reasoning and Graph Utilization:** Beyond hardware architecture, another ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù is in how we train_ these models. We should train LCMs not just to predict the next concept in text, but also to use and update a knowledge graph while doing so. This could involve multi-task learning where the model sometimes has to output a graph representation or predict relations as well as generating text. For instance, given a passage, we might train the model to produce both a summary (concept sequence) and a set of triples (graph) representing the knowledge in that passage. By doing this, the model learns to internalize a mapping between text and structured knowledge. We could also use self-supervised signals: have the model generate a graph-of-thoughts for a problem, then use a pre-trained verifier to check consistency, providing a reward or loss that pushes the model toward useful graph construction. Another idea is curriculum learning** where the model starts with simpler reasoning tasks (single-step KG usage) and progressively handles more complex multi-hop reasoning with KGs. Architecturally, this might not change the wiring of the model, but it changes the behavior_: we‚Äôd get an LCM that is inherently good at interfacing with graphs because it was trained to do so. This addresses a current gap: today‚Äôs LCMs are trained on narrative text, not on reasoning traces or graph data. By creating new datasets (perhaps synthetic) of thought graphs and concept sequences, we can teach the model the ‚Äúlanguage of thought‚Äù more explicitly. The end result would be an LCM that, from the get-go, knows how to build and navigate a knowledge graph of thoughts, rather than treating it as a bolted-on afterthought.\n\nIn summary, the architecture of future Large Concept Models could evolve to include dynamical decoders with oscillatory control, graph-aware attention, persistent memory modules, and geometrically structured embedding spaces**. These changes aim to give the model an internal sense of conceptual space and structure_ so that it can more fluidly interface with explicit knowledge graphs. By drawing on principles observed in human cognition (rhythmic cycles, memory consolidation, semantic networks), we push LCMs into a new territory that surpasses the current SONAR-based designs. The payoff would be AI systems capable of deep, continuous reasoning ‚Äì effectively bridging neural and symbolic approaches for the first time at scale.\nApplications Across Domains and Emergent Capabilities\n\nThe marriage of KGoT and LCMs is not just a technical novelty; it stands to impact a wide range of application domains by enabling transfer of knowledge and emergent intelligent behavior. Here we explore several key domains and how they could benefit:\n\n- \n\nCognitive Modeling &amp; Psychology:** In cognitive science, researchers strive to model how the human mind formulates thoughts, remembers facts, and solves problems. An AI that uses a graph of thoughts and concept-level reasoning provides a natural testbed for cognitive theories. For instance, a cognitive model might propose that humans organize knowledge in semantic networks and reason by traversing those networks. Our KGoT+LCM system does exactly that in silico. By comparing the AI‚Äôs graph of thoughts to those created by human subjects (through concept mapping exercises or think-aloud protocols), cognitive scientists can evaluate the fidelity of different reasoning strategies. This AI could also be used to simulate patients for psychological testing ‚Äì e.g., modeling how a person with a certain memory impairment might fail to solve a puzzle by removing nodes from the graph. Moreover, the ability of LCMs to operate in a language-agnostic way is useful for cross-linguistic cognitive studies: the same concept graph can be mapped to different languages, mirroring how underlying thought might be language-independent. In education, understanding how an expert vs. a novice builds a graph of a topic could tailor teaching methods; the AI assistant could explicitly show a learner ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how an expert‚Äôs knowledge graph on this topic looks compared to yours.‚Äù The explainability** of the system fosters a human-AI collaborative learning environment where the AI‚Äôs emerging reasoning patterns (and even mistakes) can be analyzed to shed light on human reasoning‚Äãfile-czsvt95dcjytwfsnlgeqlv.\n\n- \n\nReal-Time Reasoning in Dynamic Environments:** Consider a domain like robotics and autonomous systems**, where an AI must make split-second decisions based on streaming sensor data. Traditional LLMs are ill-suited for this, as they lack long-term memory and can‚Äôt update their knowledge base in real-time. A KGoT+LCM-based control system could maintain a live knowledge graph of the environment and mission objectives, constantly updated as new sensor inputs (as concept embeddings) come in. The LCM can reason about the current graph to plan actions. For example, an autonomous drone could use it to avoid hazards: the drone‚Äôs perception updates the graph with new obstacle nodes; the LCM reasons on the graph to reroute path planning. Because the system can handle new info on the fly, it exhibits situational awareness** that static models lack. Similarly, in finance, an AI trader could keep a knowledge graph of market events and trends, updating it in real-time as news arrives, and use concept-level predictions to foresee market shifts. The cross-modal ability means it could combine numeric data, news text, and even speech from earnings calls into one reasoning framework. Transferability** is key here: the concept embeddings allow it to connect, say, a news event in Japanese to a U.S. stock it affects. Emergent capabilities like early warning signals could arise, as the AI notices patterns (subgraphs) forming that historically led to a crisis. The system improves over time by learning which graph patterns are critical (persistent memory). This goes beyond what any current LLM or graph algorithm can do in isolation ‚Äì it‚Äôs a continuous reasoning agent, almost like a human operator that never forgets a detail and can recall any needed info in a structured way.\n\n- \n\nScientific Discovery and Research Assistance:** One of the most exciting applications is using these AI systems to accelerate research and discovery. Scientific research** often involves connecting dots across many papers, experiments, and hypotheses ‚Äì essentially building a giant knowledge graph in the researcher‚Äôs mind. An AI with KGoT+LCM could ingest vast amounts of literature (as concepts and relations) and construct a comprehensive knowledge graph of a field. It could then help researchers identify gaps or novel connections. For example, in drug discovery, the AI might combine a graph of chemical compounds with a graph of disease pathways to suggest a new compound that could affect a disease, finding a link no human noticed. Because LCMs handle multiple languages and modalities, it could include findings from international journals, patents, and even experimental data graphs. Emergent hypotheses** might be generated by the AI traversing the graph: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting that Protein X in cancer is connected to Pathway Y in Alzheimer‚Äôs in the literature graph ‚Äì maybe a drug targeting X could help Y.‚Äù This is analogous to how genetic networks (a higher-level view of DNA interactions) led biologists to new therapies beyond what looking at individual genes offered. By moving to a network-of-concepts paradigm, the AI can leverage systems-level behavior (feedback loops, multi-hop chains) to propose experiments. There are already hints of this opportunity ‚Äì LCMs have been highlighted for enabling deeper exploration of how ideas relate across fields‚Äãfile-czsvt95dcjytwfsnlgeqlv. By giving the AI a persistent memory of scientific knowledge, each query a scientist asks can build on the last, resulting in a research companion_ that accumulates knowledge over months and can recall why a hypothesis was discarded or supported. The explainability is crucial here: when suggesting a discovery, the AI can show the chain of papers or data points (as a concept subgraph) that lead to that suggestion, helping the scientist evaluate its plausibility.\n\n- \n\nPersonal Assistants and Lifelong Learning:** In the realm of personal AI assistants, a KGoT+LCM system could be transformative. Today‚Äôs assistants (Alexa, Siri, etc.) have very limited memory of past interactions. Imagine a personal assistant that over time builds a personal knowledge graph** of your life ‚Äì your preferences, schedule, knowledge, relationships, and goals ‚Äì all in a structured form (with your control and privacy). The LCM would allow it to reason at a high level: it could summarize whole email threads into a ‚Äúconcept‚Äù and store that in your graph, rather than trying to remember exact wording. When you ask it for help, it doesn‚Äôt just have a history of utterances; it has an evolving map of you_. This enables a host of emergent features: truly proactive assistance (it can infer from your goal nodes and task list what you might need next), personalized recommendations that are logically explainable (‚ÄúI suggest this book because it connects to these topics you enjoyed, see the concept map‚Äù), and continuity of service (it remembers context indefinitely). Compositional generalization** means it could take two things you said months apart and combine them to solve a new query ‚Äì something current chatbots often fail at. For example, you once explained your dietary restrictions, and months later you ask for restaurant suggestions for a business dinner; the assistant should merge your dietary node and the colleague‚Äôs preference node to find a suitable place. Because it reasons with concepts, it can do this without needing an explicit reminder. Importantly, this approach also allows for better user control and explainability** in personal assistants: the user could inspect their own knowledge graph and edit or remove things (maybe the assistant learned something incorrect about them ‚Äì they can just delete that node). The assistant can also show ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs my thought process‚Äù in a friendly visual graph when making a complex suggestion, making the interaction more transparent and trustable. Over time, such an assistant basically becomes an external augmentation of the user‚Äôs own memory and reasoning ‚Äì a true ‚Äúsecond brain‚Äù that complements human cognition.\n\nIn all these domains, a common thread is that moving from token-level to concept-level with a structured graph enables transfer of knowledge and skills** to new scenarios. The concept of emergent capabilities refers to behaviors that were not explicitly programmed but arise from the rich interplay of components. We anticipate phenomena like: analogies across domains (as described), the ability to self-debug reasoning (since the system can see its own graph and notice contradictions), and even rudimentary forms of theory of mind (the AI could maintain a subgraph representing another agent‚Äôs knowledge or intentions, and reason about that ‚Äì enabling social reasoning). These are akin to an AI developing higher-order cognition by dint of having to manage and navigate an explicit store of knowledge about the world and itself.\n\nThere‚Äôs an analogy to be made with the evolution of intelligence in nature: simple reflexes (like token-based responses) scaled up to symbolic reasoning (concepts/language), and the next leap was organizing those symbols into structured knowledge (culture, science ‚Äì effectively large graphs of knowledge humanity builds). KGoT+LCM is an attempt to have machines partake in that next leap ‚Äì not just to parse and generate language, but to organize and use knowledge in a persistent, structured form. If successful, the applications could be as revolutionary as the development of libraries or the internet, because we‚Äôd have AI that accumulates knowledge** and reasons with it over time**. Realizing this across domains will take time, but the feasibility is supported by early evidence that each piece (graphs, LCMs) provides gains in capability‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu‚Äãinfoq.com. The convergence of the two could be a turning point toward more general, adaptive, and explainable intelligence** in our machines.\nFrom Tokens to Networks: A New Paradigm in AI\n\nThe integration of Knowledge Graphs of Thoughts with Large Concept Models represents a paradigm shift in AI, analogous to biological evolution moving from linear DNA sequences to complex genetic regulatory networks. Traditional LLMs** operate like DNA or RNA sequences ‚Äì processing one ‚Äúbase‚Äù (token) after another, with implicit interactions encoded in the sequence itself. LCMs** step up to something like the level of genes: each concept (sentence) is a meaningful unit, and interactions (order of sentences) capture higher-level structure‚Äãfile-czsvt95dcjytwfsnlgeqlv. But the combination, a concept-network AI**, is akin to a full genetic network or neural circuit ‚Äì where ideas (like genes or neurons) interact in a web of relationships, enabling feedback loops, memory, and regulation that a simple sequence cannot achieve. This network-level processing is fundamentally more powerful and expressive, yielding emergent behaviors (in biology, life itself emerges from genetic networks; in AI, perhaps consciousness-like context or highly adaptive reasoning could emerge from concept networks).\n\nTo crystallize this transformation, consider the progression:\nAspectLLM (Token-level)LCM (Sentence-level)KGoT + LCM (Concept Network)Basic Unit of Reasoning**Sub-word or word tokens (e.g. ‚Äúintelli-‚Äù ‚Äúgence‚Äù)Whole sentences or semantic chunks (‚ÄúIntelligence is...‚Äù)Concepts as nodes in a graph (‚ÄúIntelligence‚Äù node linked to ‚Äúlearning‚Äù node)Context Handling**Limited by fixed window (e.g. 2048 tokens); beyond that, forgetsExtended via concept chunks (fewer steps for same content)‚Äãinfoq.com; better coherencePotentially unlimited via external graph memory (remembers all nodes); context grows dynamically with knowledge graphMemory Persistence**No memory across sessions; each prompt is freshCan carry summary of past as one concept, but largely reset each timeLong-term memory through persistent knowledge graph; can retain information indefinitely and retrieve it when neededReasoning Style**Sequential chain-of-thought (hidden in weights/activations)Sequential at concept level (each step = an idea); some hierarchical reasoningGraph traversal and update; can do branching, backtracking, multi-hop reasoning explicitly in the graph structureKnowledge Representation**Implicit in model weights (plus prompt retrieval); prone to hallucinationPartly implicit, partly via concept embeddings (which can be decoded to check content)Largely explicit in the knowledge graph (facts stored as triples); easier verification and grounding of claimsMulti-domain/Modal**Requires separate handling (multimodal LLMs exist but each input is serialized as tokens)Native support for text and speech via SONAR‚Äãinfoq.com; still needs extension for images (not in SONAR yet)Unified representation for text, speech, images (if extended SONAR); graph can hold all modalities as concepts, enabling seamless cross-modal reasoningAdaptability**Fine-tuning or prompting needed for new tasks; tends to be rigid once trainedMore zero-shot generalization at concept level reported‚Äãinfoq.com; still needs fine-tuning for major new domainsHigh adaptability: new knowledge can be added to graph on the fly; can quickly learn new facts or rules by inserting nodes/edges rather than retraining the whole modelExplainability**Low ‚Äì reasoning is hidden in a giant vector space; explanations must be extracted post-hocMedium ‚Äì can output one sentence per thought, which is somewhat interpretable, but the process is still sequentialHigh ‚Äì reasoning trace is the knowledge graph itself, which can be visualized and traced; each thought is a node that can be examined with its links‚Äãfile-czsvt95dcjytwfsnlgeqlvEmergent Behavior**Observed (e.g. in-context learning) but often unpredictable and hard to controlSome emergent abstraction capabilities (language-agnostic understanding, summarizing long text)‚Äãinfoq.comRich emergent phenomena expected: analogical reasoning, self-correction by graph analysis, formation of abstract concept clusters, etc., due to network effects and explicit structure‚Äãlink.springer.comComputational Cost**High for long outputs (each token predicted); scales quadratically with lengthMore efficient for long outputs (predicts one sentence in one go); but concept embedding and decoding adds overheadGraph operations + concept decoding add overhead; however, can skip generation by retrieving from KG; cost can be traded off by using more retrieval, fewer generations (hybrid approach)Example**Solving a puzzle by generating text step by step, possibly repeating or losing trackSolving a puzzle by generating a few key steps as sentences (‚ÄúFirst, do X. Then Y.‚Äù) more coherentlySolving a puzzle by building a graph of clues and deducing answer via graph queries, with each step explained in the graph, ensuring consistency\n\nIn this table, we see how moving to concept networks could combine the best of both worlds**: the raw power of neural embeddings and the clarity of symbolic reasoning. This new paradigm doesn‚Äôt discard what made LLMs successful (the ability to learn from massive data); it augments it with a structured, manipulable memory.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth noting that implementing this vision is a grand challenge**. It demands advances in multiple areas of AI: representation learning (for better concept embeddings), graph algorithms (for real-time, large-scale operation), continual learning (for the model to evolve its knowledge), and even user experience (to present graphs to users in meaningful ways). However, the feasibility is supported by current trends. The literature already demonstrates pieces: LLM + KG integrations improving interpretability and decision-making‚Äãlink.springer.com, LCMs enabling concept-level generalization‚Äãinfoq.com, and KGoT showing that even today‚Äôs smaller models can outperform bigger ones when armed with structured knowledge‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu.\n\nThe trajectory of AI research suggests increasing hybridization of neural and symbolic methods**. KGoT with LCM is a prime example of such hybrid systems. By anchoring high-level neural computations to an external graph, we get a control loop that can be inspected, supervised, and guided. One could imagine future AI training where a human teacher can literally watch the AI‚Äôs thought graph and give feedback at that level (‚Äúyou‚Äôve drawn a wrong conclusion between these concepts‚Äù) ‚Äì a far more intuitive feedback than tweaking loss functions.\n\nIn conclusion, implementing Knowledge Graphs of Thoughts with Large Concept Models is a bold endeavor that pushes beyond the limitations of current architectures like Meta‚Äôs SONAR-based LCM. It plays to the strengths of both symbolic and subsymbolic AI**, mitigating their weaknesses. The SWOT analysis indicates significant strengths (interpretable reasoning, better memory, multi-modal integration) and opportunities (new capabilities in reasoning and learning), while also flagging the weaknesses and threats that need to be addressed (system complexity, performance parity with giant LLMs, etc.). By addressing those through architectural innovations (like the oscillator decoder and graph-aware attention) and smart use of existing knowledge (graphs, embeddings), we can chart a path forward.\n\nThe shift from token sequences to concept networks in AI is akin to a scientific revolution in our approach to machine intelligence. We are moving from the realm of ‚Äúnext-word prediction‚Äù to ‚Äúnext-idea prediction‚Äù**, and further to ‚Äúnetwork-state evolution‚Äù** ‚Äì where the goal is not merely to continue a text, but to maintain and grow a connected web of understanding. This is a more challenging objective, but also a more meaningful one if we aim for AI that truly understands, remembers, and reasons** about the world. The feasibility study here shows that while challenges remain, there are no fundamental barriers in sight, and the potential payoffs in capability and alignment are enormous. By combining Large Concept Models with Knowledge Graphs of Thoughts, we take a decisive step toward AI systems that think in structured, human-like ways**, bridging the gap between raw statistical power and interpretable knowledge manipulation. This synthesis could very well be the blueprint for the next generation of AI ‚Äì one that not only generates language, but organizes knowledge and yields insights, much like a human expert (albeit one with perfect recall and tireless logical faculties). The journey from tokens to concepts to knowledge networks is just beginning, but it is a journey that holds the promise of AI that is more general, reliable, and transparent_ than ever before. link.springer.com‚Äãfile-czsvt95dcjytwfsnlgeqlv\n\n**ChatGPT**: How about Lexo**? It‚Äôs short, two syllables, and rolls off the tongue like ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù or ‚ÄúYahoo.‚Äù The name hints at language and knowledge (think ‚Äúlexicon‚Äù) while also sounding futuristic and high tech‚Äîperfect for a system that fuses dynamic knowledge graphs with emergent, concept-level reasoning. It captures the essence of our breakthrough: an AI that doesn‚Äôt just explain but thinks in interconnected, high-level concepts.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n**ChatGPT**: - \n\nLarge Context Model**\nThe term \"Large Context Model\" is a descriptive phrase rather than a trademarked or proprietary term.

That said, you should always consult with legal experts if you plan on using it as a brand or product name for commercial purposes.\n\n- \n\nMoving from SONAR to RWKV-7**\nTransitioning from SONAR to RWKV-7 can be an interesting direction. RWKV models offer a different approach (they blend RNN-like behavior with transformer architecture) that might be well-suited for concept-level processing. Exploring RWKV-7 for your project might yield unique performance or integration benefits compared to SONAR.\n\n- \n\nAccessing Your ChatGPT Project**\nI can indeed help review and discuss your ChatGPT project.

The term Large Concept Model** is a descriptive term referring to models that operate on whole concepts (like sentences or semantic units) rather than tokens. It‚Äôs not known to be trademarked or proprietary.

Enjoy this phase‚Äîsometimes the best ideas form during these moments of playful exploration!\n\n**ChatGPT**: Sounds great‚ÄîLCN (Large Concept Network) is a strong, evocative name that captures the vision of a vast, interconnected structure of concepts powering your system. It conveys both scale and the structured, conceptual reasoning that sets it apart from traditional models.\n\nIf you need any further ideas or help refining the concept, I'm here to assist!\n\n**ChatGPT**: Absolutely. Transitioning from SONAR to RWKV-7 is an intriguing idea. RWKV-7‚Äôs architecture‚Äîcombining the efficiency and sequential processing of RNNs with the scalability and parallelism of Transformers‚Äîcould offer several advantages for concept-level processing in your LCN framework. Here are a few potential benefits:\n\n- \n\nEnhanced Sequential Understanding:** RWKV-7‚Äôs RNN-like behavior might enable it to better capture long-term dependencies and context, essential for maintaining coherent concept flows over extended sequences.\n\n- \n\nScalability with Efficiency:** The hybrid nature of RWKV-7 can allow for more efficient parallel processing compared to traditional RNNs, without sacrificing the sequential insight that is critical for high-level concept reasoning.\n\n- \n\nIntegration with Knowledge Graphs:** Its architecture could be more amenable to integrating with a dynamic knowledge graph, as the recurrent elements can naturally align with updates in a persistent memory, enhancing the synergy between the LCN and its underlying model.\n\n- \n\nPotential for Lower Latency:** Given its design, RWKV-7 might offer lower latency in generation compared to traditional transformer models, which could be beneficial when real-time reasoning and interaction with a knowledge graph are required.\n\nThis transition aligns well with the broader vision of building a system that moves from token-level to concept-level reasoning. It‚Äôs worth experimenting with RWKV-7 within your framework to see if its strengths translate into better performance or more coherent outputs for your use cases. If you have any further questions or need help with integrating RWKV-7 into your LCN, feel free to ask!\n\n**ChatGPT**: That's fantastic to hear! The idea that integrating RWKV-7 with a dynamic knowledge graph could not only be more natural but also bring additional benefits is very compelling. To recap, the key reasons include:\n\n- \n\nEnhanced Sequential Understanding:** RWKV-7‚Äôs RNN-like properties are ideal for tracking long-term dependencies and context, which pairs well with a knowledge graph that continuously updates your working memory.\n\n- \n\nScalability and Efficiency:** Its hybrid architecture enables efficient parallel processing, ensuring that the system remains responsive even as the knowledge graph grows and evolves.\n\n- \n\nSeamless Graph Integration:** The recurrent elements can naturally sync with the dynamic updates of the knowledge graph, allowing for more coherent, real-time reasoning that incorporates new information on the fly.\n\nThese advantages together suggest that moving from SONAR to RWKV-7 could help overcome several hurdles in integrating concept-level reasoning with dynamic knowledge graphs, making your LCN even more robust.\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into specific integration strategies or discuss potential hurdles and solutions further, just let me know!\n\n**ChatGPT**: Yes, there are several key weaknesses to be aware of when integrating an LCM with a dynamic knowledge graph. Here‚Äôs a brief recap of the main challenges:\n\n- \n\nSystem Complexity:**\nCombining an LCM with a knowledge graph introduces multiple moving parts‚Äîthe neural model, the graph memory, the interface between them, and any external tools. Coordinating these in real-time can be challenging, and each added component increases the risk of failure or bugs.\n\n- \n\nMaturity of LCM Technology:**\nCurrent Large Concept Models, while promising, still lag behind state-of-the-art LLMs in certain nuanced tasks. Their concept-level approach may sometimes lose fine-grained detail, and integrating them with a knowledge graph adds another layer of complexity that isn‚Äôt yet fully explored in production systems.\n\n- \n\nAlignment and Interface Challenges:**\nMapping between the continuous, dense concept embeddings of an LCM and the symbolic, discrete nature of a knowledge graph is non-trivial. Ensuring that generated concepts can be accurately inserted into the graph‚Äîand vice versa‚Äîis an ongoing challenge that could lead to inconsistencies if not managed carefully.\n\n- \n\nScalability and Real-Time Constraints:**\nAs the knowledge graph grows, updating and querying it efficiently becomes critical. Traditional graph databases like Neo4j have limitations in handling high-frequency, real-time updates typical in a dynamic reasoning environment, while in-memory solutions (like NetworkX) might struggle with scalability.\n\n- \n\nError Accumulation:**\nIn a system where each reasoning step updates the graph, any small error can propagate or compound over time. This risk of error accumulation means that without robust validation and self-correction mechanisms, the system‚Äôs overall reliability could degrade as more nodes and edges are added.\n\nEach of these challenges represents an area where further research and innovative engineering can pave the way toward more robust, efficient, and explainable AI. If you‚Äôd like to explore any of these weaknesses in more detail or discuss potential mitigations, just let me know!\n\n**ChatGPT**: Absolutely. To make the upcoming report as powerful and practical as possible, could you please clarify:\n\n- \n\nAre you focusing on overcoming these limitations specifically in the context of your evolving KWKV-7 decoder and Large Concept Network (LCN), or are you also interested in general-purpose solutions applicable to other architectures?\n\n- \n\nShould I prioritize real-time, production-ready strategies (e.g., engineering solutions, libraries, APIs), or focus more on theoretical and research-backed architectural innovations?\n\n- \n\nDo you have a preferred deployment environment (e.g., cloud-based, edge computing, open source toolchains) or constraints I should factor in (e.g., privacy, cost, latency)?\n\nOnce I have this context, I‚Äôll dig in deeply‚Äîacross AI, neuroscience, distributed systems, symbolic logic, and other cutting-edge areas‚Äîto deliver a world-changing strategy.\n\n**ChatGPT**: Excellent.

The Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT)** architecture is a prime example, combining an LLM‚Äôs reasoning with an evolving knowledge graph to solve tasks with smaller models‚Äãmedium.com. KGoT demonstrated that structuring information into a knowledge graph dramatically improves task success (e.g. ~29% higher success on GAIA benchmark) while cutting costs by over 36√ó‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. However, building such an LCN system raises several known challenges**: high system complexity from orchestrating many components, limitations of current LCMs‚Äô capabilities, difficulties aligning neural concept embeddings_ with symbolic graph nodes, real-time update and scalability constraints for large graphs, error accumulation in iterative reasoning, and shortcomings of existing graph tooling (e.g. Neo4j, NetworkX) for this new paradigm. This report presents a comprehensive architectural plan to overcome these weaknesses. We explore solutions drawn from state-of-the-art AI research and analogies in biology, cognitive science, and distributed systems to design a resilient, coherent, and extensible_ infrastructure for human-aligned, AGI-level reasoning via LCNs. Clear module definitions, hybrid techniques, and long-term adaptability are emphasized. In the following sections, we address each challenge in depth and propose robust strategies, including novel controller frameworks, hybrid neural-symbolic interfaces, streaming graph processing engines, self-healing memory loops, and next-generation knowledge graph stores.\nReducing System Complexity and Orchestration Overhead\n\n Synchronization overhead is inevitable in multi-component systems (‚ÄúThere is always sync‚Äù). Effective architectures minimize the cost of keeping the LCM and knowledge graph coherent._\n\nA core challenge is the complexity of orchestrating** an LCM together with a dynamic knowledge graph and assorted tools (web search, calculators, etc.). In KGoT, for instance, a centralized Controller** coordinates between an LLM, a Graph Store, and external tool modules‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. This design works but can incur significant overhead as the system scales: the controller must manage real-time updates to the graph, schedule tool invocations, and feed graph data back into the model‚Äôs prompts, all in a tight loop. Such orchestration can become a bottleneck, especially as we aim for real-time_ operation and low-latency reasoning. To reduce complexity and overhead, we propose several architectural strategies:\n\n- \n\nAgent-Based Decomposition:** Break the monolithic controller into microservice-like agents**, each responsible for a specific function (e.g. a Graph Updater Agent, a Query Planner, a Verification Agent, etc.). This actor model_ or microservice_ approach (inspired by distributed systems) localizes complexity ‚Äì each agent is simpler, focusing on one task ‚Äì and they communicate asynchronously via messages or a shared blackboard (the knowledge graph). Such designs draw on the classic blackboard architecture_ in AI, where independent specialist modules post and read facts on a common knowledge blackboard. By using an event bus or message queue, the system becomes event-driven**: for example, when the LCM produces a new thought, an event triggers the Graph Updater agent to incorporate it into the KG, which in turn triggers a Reasoner agent to query for next steps, etc. This reduces the need for a single orchestrator to micromanage every step, improving parallelism and modularity. The system‚Äôs components naturally synchronize through the graph updates (similar to how microservices share state via databases or publish/subscribe events in distributed apps).\n\n- \n\nDedicated Controller Frameworks:** If a central coordinator is still used, it should be lightweight and possibly learned. One idea is a learned meta-controller_ (e.g. a policy model) that decides which module to call next, rather than a hard-coded sequence. Alternatively, utilize an agent framework** (such as LangChain or a custom Reinforcement Learning-based planner) that optimizes the decision-making sequence. The controller can operate on a higher abstraction ‚Äì e.g. planning which high-level subtask to tackle next ‚Äì instead of micromanaging graph synchronization. Frameworks for multi-agent coordination or workflow orchestration (like Ray, Dask, or ROS in robotics) could manage scheduling and resource allocation, so the overhead of coordination is handled by proven infrastructure. The key is to decouple what_ needs to happen from how_ it is scheduled, reducing complexity.\n\n- \n\nEvent-Driven Graph Synchronization:** Adopting an event-driven model** for graph‚Äìmodel sync ensures changes propagate efficiently. Instead of the LCM continuously polling the knowledge graph for updates, the graph can emit events** when updated (‚ÄúNode X added‚Äù or ‚ÄúEdge Y modified‚Äù). Subscribers (like the LCM‚Äôs context manager) get notified and can fetch the delta. This is analogous to reactive programming** or how GUIs use events to update views. For instance, if the KG gains new info about a concept, an event triggers the LCM to integrate that into its next reasoning step (e.g. by regenerating the context embedding). Event-driven sync minimizes idle waiting and keeps the model‚Äôs knowledge timely with minimal overhead. In distributed database terms, it‚Äôs like using a change data capture feed to keep caches in sync, rather than expensive synchronous transactions on every update.\n\n- \n\nHybrid Memory Paradigms:** We propose blending the LCM‚Äôs internal memory with the external graph memory to simplify data flow. One approach is a memory hierarchy**: treat the LCM‚Äôs hidden state or short-term context as Level-1 cache_ and the knowledge graph as Level-2 memory_. The controller (or agents) ensures recently used knowledge from the KG is cached_ in the LCM‚Äôs context window, while less relevant details remain in the graph. This resembles how the human brain might use working memory (prefrontal cortex) for immediate thoughts and long-term memory (distributed cortical networks) for stored knowledge ‚Äì managing what‚Äôs ‚Äúin mind‚Äù vs. in the background. By formalizing such a hierarchy, we reduce the complexity of frequent graph lookups: only cache misses require a costly retrieval from the KG. Techniques like context pruning** (keeping the LCM‚Äôs input prompt focused on the currently relevant subgraph) can enforce this discipline. Another paradigm is echo state memory**, where the LCM writes salient intermediate results to the graph (externalizing them) and reads them back only when needed, rather than carrying all intermediate details in its own state. This offloading strategy simplifies the model‚Äôs job (it doesn‚Äôt need to remember everything) and the controller‚Äôs job (since the KG becomes a source of truth for past facts). It also mirrors how biological memory consolidates complex thoughts into external notes or diagrams for humans, simplifying cognitive load.\n\n- \n\nParallel and Asynchronous Processing:** A complex LCN pipeline can be streamlined by performing independent operations in parallel. For example, while the LCM is generating the next concept, the graph maintenance tasks from the previous step (e.g. running consistency checks or writing to a database) could run concurrently on another thread or agent. Using a thread-safe or multi-process graph store (or multiple graph shards) would allow reads and writes to happen without strictly sequential gating by a controller. In effect, the LCM and KG ‚Äúdance‚Äù asynchronously yet stay loosely synchronized through eventual consistency. Techniques from distributed computing, such as lock-free data structures** or CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types)**, could allow the knowledge graph to accept concurrent updates from different agents and merge them consistently. Embracing eventual consistency_ (with quick reconciliation) can markedly reduce orchestration overhead compared to enforcing strict sequential consistency at all times. The system would tolerate slight delays in synchronization (much as distributed databases do) in exchange for big gains in throughput and simplicity of each component‚Äôs design.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, we expect to simplify the orchestration** of LCM+KG systems. Each component (LCM, graph, tools) can operate more independently, communicating through well-defined channels. This not only reduces overhead but also makes the system more robust and extensible. New tools or modules can be added as new agents without rewriting a central loop ‚Äì improving the extensibility_ towards AGI. The design aligns with how brains and large organizations handle complexity**: through decentralization, event-driven signaling (neuronal spikes or message passing), and layered memory systems. Ultimately, a well-architected LCN will appear less like a tangle of custom calls and more like a cohesive ecosystem** of processes coordinating through the shared language of the knowledge graph**.\nMitigating Early-Stage LCM Limitations (Maturity &amp; Performance)\n\nCurrent Large Concept Models are in their infancy ‚Äì for example, Meta‚Äôs 7B-parameter LCM operates on sentence embeddings and shows promise (outperforming same-size LLMs in zero-shot multilingual tasks‚Äãfile-vxpa6t5qu6nxmxvzn1kkvh), but it is not yet as generally capable as a GPT-4 class model. Early LCMs may struggle with nuanced reasoning, complex multi-hop queries, or domain-specific knowledge, limiting LCN performance. We propose a multifaceted approach to boost the effective performance of LCMs** in an LCN system, using both architectural enhancements and training methodologies:\n\n- \n\nHybrid LLM‚ÄìLCM Architectures:** Rather than relying solely on an immature LCM, we can combine it with traditional Large Language Models (LLMs)** to get the best of both. One hybrid approach is to use the LCM for high-level planning and the LLM for detailed execution. For instance, the LCM (operating in concept space) might generate the broad strokes of a solution ‚Äì a sequence of conceptual steps or an outline knowledge graph ‚Äì and then an LLM can be invoked to fill in granular details in natural language or code. Conversely, an LLM could be used to critique or refine_ the LCM‚Äôs outputs (as a form of self-reflection or verification), leveraging the LLM‚Äôs more matured understanding of language nuances. By routing tasks to the model best suited**, we mitigate weaknesses: the LCM handles abstraction and modality-agnostic reasoning, whereas the LLM handles tasks requiring richly detailed world knowledge or precise linguistic output. Such a division of labor is analogous to a team where a strategist (LCM) plans and a subject-matter expert (LLM) checks the plan. Architecturally, this could be implemented with a model router** that inspects each query or subtask and decides which model (or combination) should process it ‚Äì akin to an ensemble-of-experts approach. Early experiments in mixing models (e.g. HuggingFace Agents mixing GPT-4 and tools‚Äãmedium.com) show that even a weaker model can be amplified significantly by external help; here we apply that principle by pairing LCMs with complementary LLMs.\n\n- \n\nTask-Specific Expert Routing:** Beyond just LLM vs LCM, an LCN could include multiple specialized subsystems. We envision a cognitive router** that directs queries to the appropriate ‚Äúexpert‚Äù module: e.g. a mathematical problem might be handed to a dedicated math solver tool or a fine-tuned algebraic LLM, a coding task to a code model, and conceptual reasoning tasks to the LCM. This is similar to how human cognition uses different mental faculties for different problems (logical reasoning, visual imagination, arithmetic calculation, etc.). The KGoT architecture already demonstrates this principle by invoking external tools (Python, calculators) for specific needs‚Äãmedium.com. We propose extending it with specialized neural modules_ as well ‚Äì for instance, a mini-LLM fine-tuned for factual question-answering could supplement the LCM‚Äôs knowledge. The router would treat the LCM as one component in a broader toolkit and learn which queries it excels at vs. when to defer to another component. Over time, this mixture-of-experts** system can be trained (possibly via reinforcement learning) to optimize cost and accuracy by allocating each query to the cheapest capable module. This mitigates the ‚Äúone model must do everything‚Äù problem of early LCMs.\n\n- \n\nCurriculum and Continual Training:** To improve LCM capabilities, we recommend a curriculum learning** approach during training. Instead of training an LCM only on generic next-concept prediction, we gradually expose it to tasks of increasing complexity and to the presence of a knowledge graph. For example, start by training it to solve simple single-hop questions with the aid of a small static knowledge graph (teaching it to integrate a given fact), then progressively introduce multi-hop reasoning and dynamic graph updates. The LCM can also be pre-trained_ on simulated sequences of reasoning steps (perhaps generated by a stronger LLM) represented in concept form, so it learns patterns of logical chains. By curriculum training, the LCM acquires robust reasoning skills step by step ‚Äì much like how humans learn arithmetic before algebra before calculus. Additionally, continual learning** should be applied: as the LCN system runs, use its accumulated knowledge and transcripts to further fine-tune the LCM. Each task the system solves can provide training data ‚Äì the correct reasoning path (verified by success) can be used to fine-tune the LCM to reproduce that chain of thought in concept space. This on-the-job learning will, over time, alleviate initial weaknesses, essentially bootstrapping_ the LCM with the system‚Äôs own experience.\n\n- \n\nInnovations in Pretraining (Concept and Graph Knowledge):** LCMs could be made stronger by injecting knowledge graph information directly into their pretraining. One idea is to augment the concept embeddings (like SONAR) with structured knowledge signals_: for instance, ensure that concept embeddings that refer to the same real-world entity (in different sentences or languages) are close in vector space, or incorporate an auxiliary loss to predict relations between concepts. Meta‚Äôs LCM used a massive corpus of 1.3T tokens to learn the concept space‚Äãfile-vxpa6t5qu6nxmxvzn1kkvh; we could further include knowledge graph triples or ontologies** in the pretraining data. For example, training the LCM to reconstruct or predict missing links in a large knowledge graph (like ConceptNet or Wikidata) could imbue it with a more factual and structured understanding. Pretraining could also employ multi-modal concepts** (images, diagrams) to enrich the notion of a ‚Äúconcept‚Äù. By broadening the pretraining to cover structured knowledge and multi-modality, the LCM would start with a stronger grasp of the world, mitigating some limitations. Additionally, techniques like knowledge distillation** from a powerful LLM into the LCM‚Äôs concept space can be used: have a GPT-4 generate many reasoning traces or summaries, encode those into concept embeddings, and train the LCM to predict those ‚Äì effectively teaching the LCM higher-level reasoning patterns discovered by LLMs.\n\n- \n\nExternal Reasoning and Tool Augmentation:** An immediate way to handle LCM‚Äôs weaknesses is to lean on external tools** for any capability it lacks. This principle was core to KGoT (using math solvers, web, etc.) and remains vital. If the LCM is not adept at arithmetic or strict logic, a symbolic reasoner or Python execution can verify its results. If it lacks up-to-date knowledge, a web search module can fetch facts which are then inserted into the knowledge graph for the LCM to consume. Over time, as LCMs mature, they might internalize more of these abilities, but in the near term the architecture should compensate externally_. One can also incorporate a verification sub-model** (discussed later) to double-check LCM outputs. In essence, we ‚Äúsurround‚Äù the LCM with a safety net of tools and checks so that its early limitations do not derail the overall system. This architecture is analogous to training wheels: it ensures robust performance now, while giving the LCM room to grow into more tasks as it improves. Notably, this approach kept KGoT‚Äôs performance high even with smaller models‚Äãmedium.com. In our design, if an LCM attempt fails or yields low confidence, the system can automatically fall back to either a larger model or a deterministic tool for that step, ensuring reliability.\n\nThrough these measures, the maturity gap** of current LCMs can be bridged. The hybrid and modular architecture ensures that no single weak link cripples the system ‚Äì the LCM is supported by other models and tools. Meanwhile, targeted training and knowledge infusion continuously improve the LCM itself. Over the long term, as LCM technology advances (more data, larger parameters, better training), the architecture can smoothly reduce its reliance on auxiliary components, transitioning responsibilities to the LCM. This flexible co-evolution of model and system will be key to eventually achieving an AGI-level LCN**: initially it‚Äôs a heterogeneous ensemble, but it could gradually become a more unified, concept-based reasoner as the LCM becomes truly powerful. Importantly, even in that future scenario, the infrastructure we build now ‚Äì for alignment, memory, error-checking, etc. ‚Äì will remain critical to maintain coherence and alignment of the AGI‚Äôs reasoning.\nAligning Symbolic Graphs with Concept Embeddings (Interface Design)\n\nA central difficulty in LCN systems is the interface between the symbolic world of the knowledge graph and the vector-based world of the LCM‚Äôs concept embeddings**. The knowledge graph represents discrete entities and relations (nodes and edges with clear symbolic meaning), whereas the LCM operates in a continuous concept space_ (e.g. 1024-dimensional sentence embeddings) where knowledge is implicit. Bridging these two representations is challenging: how do we translate the LCM‚Äôs conceptual thoughts into graph updates, and how do we feed graph knowledge back into the LCM effectively? Misalignment can lead to the model misunderstanding the graph or failing to update it correctly. We propose the following solutions for a robust bidirectional interface**:\n\n- \n\nConcept-to-Graph Disaggregation:** Each high-level thought from the LCM (often encoded as a single ‚Äúconcept‚Äù embedding representing an entire sentence or idea‚Äãmedium.com) should be decomposed into constituent nodes and relations** for the graph. Essentially, we need an information extraction_ step that maps a concept to symbolic triples. For example, if the LCM proposes a concept ‚ÄúGollum from Lord of the Rings is portrayed by Andy Serkis‚Äù, the system should add nodes/edges: \n```\nGollum (LotR) ‚Äî[portrayed_by]‚Üí Andy Serkis\n```\n‚Äãfile-fdqehnpqvyjxrereio3lbu. This disaggregation can be done via a lightweight parser or even a mini-LLM prompt that reformats the concept into a set of entities and relations. In KGoT, the LLM‚Äôs output was parsed to update the KG‚Äãmedium.com ‚Äì we formalize that into a clear module (a Graph Extractor_) that takes the LCM‚Äôs generated text (or an intermediate logical form) and inserts structured knowledge. By systematically breaking complex concepts into atomic pieces, we ensure the symbolic graph remains fine-grained and accurate**. It also aids interpretability ‚Äì each node corresponds to a simple concept (often a noun or entity) rather than an entire sentence. This process is akin to the NLP task of semantic parsing or ‚Äúgraph-of-thought‚Äù extraction. Architecturally, after the LCM generates a concept, the Graph Extractor module (which could be rule-based for known patterns or an LLM prompt template) produces triples to add to the KG. This guarantees that no matter how abstract the LCM‚Äôs thought is, it is anchored as concrete nodes and edges that the rest of the system can manipulate.\n\n- \n\nEmbedding-Tagged Nodes:** To enable the LCM to understand and refer to graph nodes, we attach embedding vectors to each node** representing its semantic content. For every node in the KG (especially those representing entities or facts), we maintain a corresponding concept embedding in the LCM‚Äôs vector space. One way to achieve this is to use the same concept encoder (like the SONAR encoder‚Äãmedium.com) on a canonical sentence describing that node. For instance, the node ‚ÄúAndy Serkis‚Äù could be tagged with the embedding of the sentence ‚ÄúAndy Serkis is an actor who portrayed Gollum‚Äù. Whenever the KG is updated with new nodes or relations, we update these node embeddings as well (possibly by re-encoding a descriptive sentence or by adjusting via a graph embedding algorithm). This creates a lookup table** from symbolic nodes to embeddings. Now, when the LCM needs to incorporate knowledge from the graph, it can retrieve the embeddings of relevant nodes and input them as ‚Äúknown concepts‚Äù. Conversely, if the LCM generates an embedding that doesn‚Äôt match an existing node, we can find the closest node embedding to see if it‚Äôs referring to a known concept (or else create a new node). In effect, each node acts as a bridge_ into concept space. The KG can be thought of as being embedded in a vector space_, enabling neural access. Some prior works on knowledge graph embeddings and alignment support this idea ‚Äì e.g. ensuring that similar entities have nearby vectors‚Äãarxiv.org. We must be careful that these embeddings stay up-to-date (graph changes should trigger recomputation of affected node vectors) and that the LCM is aware of them (perhaps by seeding its context with a set of current relevant node vectors at each step). This approach tackles the symbol grounding problem** for the LCM: it grounds abstract embeddings in concrete nodes.\n\n- \n\nGraph-to-Vector Synchronization Mechanisms:** We need protocols to keep the graph and vector representations in sync. One concept is a differentiable knowledge graph** module: treat the knowledge graph‚Äôs adjacency matrix or triples as a differentiable memory that the LCM can read and write with gradient-based operations. For example, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)_ could be employed to encode the entire KG (or subgraph) into a set of vector embeddings that the LCM can integrate with. Conversely, the LCM‚Äôs outputs could be used to update the GNN‚Äôs state. However, full differentiation through a large graph each step might be impractical; instead, we can focus on synchronizing key parts_. A simpler mechanism is iterative alignment: after each reasoning iteration, use a graph embedding algorithm** (like TransE or Node2Vec) to recompute an embedding for each node/relation based on the current graph structure, and then adjust the LCM‚Äôs concept vectors towards those if needed. This could be done by training the LCM (or a small adapter network) to predict graph-structure-based embeddings for any new concept it introduces. Over time, this ensures that the geometry of the LCM‚Äôs concept space reflects the structure of the KG. For example, if the KG links ‚ÄúX is a subset of Y‚Äù, the embeddings for X and Y might be nudged such that X‚Äôs vector is close to Y‚Äôs vector (encoding a hierarchy in vector space). Ensuring graph-structure consistency_ in embeddings can also leverage techniques from knowledge graph completion**, where models are trained to embed nodes such that known relationships are preserved as vector operations. By periodically syncing in this way, we prevent the KG and LCM from drifting apart (e.g., the KG might assert two nodes are similar, but if the LCM‚Äôs concept encoder doesn‚Äôt know that, it might treat them as far apart concepts ‚Äì sync corrects this).\n\n- \n\nVector-to-Symbol Bridge Networks:** We propose using specialized neural networks that convert continuous embeddings to symbolic choices_. For instance, a concept identification network** could take the LCM‚Äôs output embedding and classify it as either (a) referring to an existing node, (b) referring to a new concept of a certain type, or (c) a general statement that requires multiple nodes. This network effectively translates neural thoughts to graph operations_. It could be trained on data of concept embeddings labeled with the corresponding graph update (similar to how an image classifier maps image features to labels, we map concept features to knowledge graph edits). Another bridging idea is a neural parser** that operates on the LCM‚Äôs hidden states to directly predict graph links. Such components make the interface more learnable and potentially end-to-end trainable: rather than ad-hoc rules to update the graph, the system learns how to update it in order to satisfy future consistency (we could even propagate error signals if an incorrect graph update later leads the LCM astray, though that‚Äôs advanced). On the other side, a neural knowledge retriever** can learn to fetch the most relevant part of the KG for the LCM given its current context embedding. Instead of simple semantic search, this network might learn patterns like ‚Äúif the task concept is of type math problem, retrieve nodes related to known formulas‚Äù, etc. By having these intermediary neural components, we effectively create a two-way translator** between the symbolic and neural representations. This is in line with neuro-symbolic AI_ research, which argues for combining neural and symbolic methods to complement each other‚Äãarxiv.org. Here the neural part provides flexibility (generalization in embedding space) and the symbolic part provides precision (exact knowledge in the KG). Bridging networks ensure the two can talk to each other fluently.\n\n- \n\nHybrid Memory Networks:** An alternative perspective is treating the KG as a form of external memory** for the LCM that can be addressed with keys. This is reminiscent of the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC)**, which showed a neural network could learn to write and read from an external memory matrix to store structured data like family trees‚Äãdeepmind.google. We can adapt that idea: the LCM issues a query vector (key) and some address mechanism retrieves a memory (value) from the graph. In a DNC, the memory was an array of vectors; in our case, the ‚Äúmemory‚Äù could be a set of triples or a subgraph retrieved via content-based addressing. For example, the LCM could generate a key for ‚ÄúX relationship Y?‚Äù and a learned addressing module might retrieve the relevant edge from the KG if it exists (or the nearest match). Conversely, writing to memory would mean adding a new triple with an address that the addressing mechanism can index later. Essentially, we create a learned index over the knowledge graph**. The graph doesn‚Äôt need to be fully differentiable; we can use a soft addressing that retrieves a probable result which is then verified symbolically. This hybrid memory approach has the appeal of integrating KG access into the model‚Äôs computation flow, rather than treating the KG as completely separate. It blurs the line between neural and symbolic storage ‚Äì the KG is an extension of the model‚Äôs memory. In cognitive terms, it‚Äôs like semantic memory** (knowledge base) integrated with working memory** (currently active concepts), using attentional pointers. If achieved, this would significantly tighten alignment: the LCM could learn to treat certain concept embeddings as ‚Äúpointers‚Äù to detailed knowledge in the KG, and learn when to follow those pointers or update them.\n\nIn summary, aligning the LCM and the dynamic knowledge graph requires careful interface design so that they augment rather than talk past each other**. Our plan uses dual representations_ for knowledge (every fact has both a symbolic form in the KG and a vector form for the LCM) and maintains mapping between them. By continuously synchronizing and using bridging networks, the system can maintain a coherent state where the LCM‚Äôs conceptual state and the KG‚Äôs contents describe the same reality from different angles. This is analogous to how humans reconcile intuitive mental maps with explicit notes or diagrams ‚Äì each can inform the other. Successfully implemented, these interface solutions will enable the LCM to leverage the KG as if it were part of its own mind, and allow the KG to be constructed and updated with the full semantic understanding of the LCM. This bidirectional flow of knowledge_ is crucial for a unified LCN reasoning process.\nReal-Time Operation and Scalability Architecture\n\nFor LCN systems to be practical and approach AGI-level usage, they must operate in real-time (or near real-time)** and scale** to vast amounts of knowledge. A Knowledge Graph of Thoughts might grow large as an AI agent accumulates knowledge over many tasks or continuous interactions. Traditional graph databases or in-memory libraries can become a performance bottleneck if each reasoning step has to traverse or update a large graph. Additionally, if multiple updates occur per second (imagine a robotic agent perceiving and updating a scene graph continuously, or an AI assistant processing a user‚Äôs multi-turn dialogue rapidly), the infrastructure needs to support high-throughput updates and queries. We propose an architecture that borrows from streaming data systems and high-performance computing** to meet real-time and scale requirements:\n\n- \n\nStreaming Graph Engine:** Instead of a static knowledge graph, we treat the KG as a continuously evolving data stream. Technologies like Timely Dataflow** (from the Naiad system) provide a model for low-latency, incremental computation on streaming graph data‚Äãsigops.org. We suggest using a streaming dataflow engine where the nodes and edges of the knowledge graph are data tokens that can be processed in parallel. For example, imagine each new triple insertion is an event that flows through a dataflow graph which triggers any dependent computations (like if a certain query was waiting on that info). This way, complex computations on the graph (such as inference of new relations or detection of contradictions) can be maintained in the background_, updating results on the fly as new data arrives. Timely Dataflow and its derivative, Differential Dataflow**, excel at maintaining the results of declarative queries on dynamic data. In our context, we could set up continuous queries like ‚Äúfind all nodes related to the current goal concept within 2 hops‚Äù ‚Äì as the graph grows, the result of that query is incrementally updated without recomputing from scratch each time. This approach yields real-time responsiveness because the work of integrating new knowledge is done in small increments_ distributed across a pipeline. The LCM can then query recent results from these maintained views nearly instantly. In essence, the knowledge graph backend behaves like a streaming database** that is always partially computing relevant subgraphs. Adopting a dataflow paradigm also allows easy parallelization across CPU cores or even cluster nodes, since streaming frameworks are designed for distributed execution.\n\n- \n\nHigh-Performance In-Memory Graph Storage:** We recommend implementing the knowledge graph in a low-level language (Rust or C++) with in-memory storage**, to optimize speed and concurrency. For instance, a custom Rust-based graph store could use fine-grained locking or lock-free algorithms to allow concurrent reads/writes from multiple threads (leveraging Rust‚Äôs safety guarantees to avoid data races). Such an engine can outperform general-purpose graph DBs (like Neo4j) which incur overhead of ACID transactions and disk I/O. Given that an LCN‚Äôs KG can be ephemeral or at least versioned (we might not need full durability of every interim state, as long as final results are stored), sacrificing some persistence features for raw speed is acceptable. The graph can be periodically checkpointed to disk for backup, but live operation happens in memory for fast access (similar to how many trading systems or game engines manage state). Moreover, building the graph store to natively handle dynamic topology** (addition/deletion of nodes edges) is crucial ‚Äì many graph libraries are optimized for static analysis and falter when the graph is changing at runtime. Our design would use adjacency lists or edge lists that can expand, perhaps using doubling arrays or memory pools to accommodate growth without frequent allocations. We can also utilize efficient indexing: e.g. a hash map from node IDs to neighbor lists for O(1) edge lookups. Using Rust, we can also interface with modern hardware ‚Äì for example, using SIMD instructions for certain graph operations (like vectorized filtering of neighbors).\n\n- \n\nGPU/FPGA-Accelerated Graph Operations:** For extremely large graphs or heavy parallelism needs, we incorporate accelerator support**. GPUs excel at parallel traversal and similarity computations; we could offload tasks like computing embeddings for all nodes or doing a graph traversal to the GPU. For instance, frameworks like GraphBLAS (which treat graph operations as sparse matrix operations) can run on GPUs ‚Äì a breadth-first search or pagerank-like propagation of information on the graph could be done in milliseconds on GPU for millions of nodes. In an LCN, a GPU might be used to quickly compute, say, which known facts are within 2 hops of the current focus node (treating it as a matrix power operation). Also, if using neural network modules (like a GNN or the embedding synchronizer mentioned earlier), GPUs are ideal to update node embeddings in bulk when the graph grows. We might maintain two representations: the symbolic graph in CPU memory and a continuously updated embedding tensor in GPU memory. If the graph update rate is high, a custom FPGA could even be employed to manage graph changes deterministically ‚Äì FPGAs have been used in high-frequency trading to maintain graphs of market data with ultra-low latency. While that‚Äôs specialized, it shows the potential: a dedicated hardware pipeline for graph update + query can keep latency to microseconds. The combination of CPU, GPU, FPGA_ might be overkill initially, but as AGI-scale KGs could reach billions of facts, hybrid hardware could ensure scalability. The architecture would be modular to allow plugging in these accelerators for specific tasks (e.g. a GPU for similarity search, see below).\n\n- \n\nEmbedding-Indexed Subgraph Retrieval:** We leverage the fact that we have embeddings for nodes/concepts to speed up knowledge retrieval. Instead of graph traversal with many hops, we can do vector similarity search** to directly pull relevant subgraphs. For example, if the LCM needs knowledge related to concept C_, we take the embedding of C_ and perform a nearest-neighbor search in the space of node embeddings to find the top-K closest nodes (which likely are highly related concepts due to our alignment efforts). This can be done extremely fast using approximate nearest neighbor libraries (like FAISS or HNSW indexes) which handle millions of vectors. By retrieving a handful of closest nodes and their immediate neighbors, we assemble a candidate subgraph that is likely relevant to C_ without exploring the entire KG symbolically. This embedding-indexed retrieval_ is essentially a form of semantic search** over the KG‚Äôs contents. It complements traditional graph queries: if a precise relationship is needed, the KG can be queried exactly; but if a broad context is needed, the vector search gives a quick fuzzy result. Importantly, we must manage noise ‚Äì not every nearest neighbor will be actually relevant (especially if the embedding space is not perfectly aligned to all relation types‚Äãarxiv.org). We can mitigate this by intersecting the results with some symbolic constraints (e.g. only return nearest neighbors that also share a type or have some path to the query node). Nonetheless, this method prunes the search space dramatically and scales sub-linearly** with KG size ‚Äì finding similar vectors in a large set is well-studied and can be done with sub-linear time using indexes. As LCM concept embeddings are multi-modal and language-agnostic‚Äãmedium.com‚Äãmedium.com, this retrieval can even work when the query is an image or non-English text: the concept embedding will still retrieve related knowledge graph nodes (because the KG nodes might be tagged with embeddings in that same space). Essentially, the embedding index becomes a fast ‚Äúknowledge oracle‚Äù for the LCM, analogous to how humans can recall related concepts by association rather than sequential search.\n\n- \n\nTopological Pruning and Compression:** To handle scalability**, we must ensure the graph doesn‚Äôt grow unusably dense or large in irrelevant ways. We introduce policies for pruning the knowledge graph** and compressing information. One strategy is to remove or archive portions of the graph that are not relevant to current goals. For example, if the LCN has moved on from a certain task or context, the detailed subgraph constructed for that can be stored offline (in a database or file) and cleared from active memory, leaving perhaps only a summary node behind. This is akin to how humans forget details of a concluded task but retain a high-level summary. We can implement a time-to-live (TTL)_ for nodes that are not accessed or updated for a long time ‚Äì they get stale and are offloaded. Another strategy is structural compression**: identify subgraphs that are internally highly connected (cliques or clusters) and compress them into a single compound node with an aggregated representation. For instance, if the KG built a detailed chain of reasoning with many intermediate nodes, and we‚Äôve validated the outcome, we might compress that chain into a single ‚Äúproof summary‚Äù node that links input and result, thereby simplifying the graph while preserving correctness (with ability to expand it from logs if needed). Graph topology algorithms can help find parts to compress, like using community detection or motif detection to replace a frequently occurring structure with a single abstract node. Additionally, pruning by relevance** uses measures like node degree, centrality, or distance from the focus of attention: if a node is very peripheral (few connections and far from any active query), it could be a candidate for removal or marking as inactive. This keeps the ‚Äúworking set‚Äù of the graph bounded. We can also limit depth of exploration explicitly ‚Äì e.g., when retrieving context for the LCM, don‚Äôt traverse beyond 3 hops from the focus node to avoid exponential growth of considered facts. Empirically, many reasoning tasks don‚Äôt require very long chains (and if they do, perhaps an iterative deepening approach is better). By bounding the scope** in space (pruning unused nodes) and time (archiving old knowledge), we ensure the graph remains lean and pertinent_, which greatly improves real-time performance.\n\n- \n\nScalable Distributed Architecture:** For truly large scales, the knowledge graph can be distributed across multiple servers or shards**. Techniques from large-scale graph processing can apply (e.g. partitioning the graph by communities or types, so that queries mostly hit one partition). A distributed graph database (like NebulaGraph or JanusGraph) or even a custom sharded solution could be used, where each node runs our high-perf graph engine on a subset of the data. Cross-partition communication would be handled via message passing (similar to how distributed databases do scatter-gather for queries). The streaming dataflow approach fits well here: timely dataflow already supports distributed execution by splitting data by keys. The key design principle is to avoid any single component becoming a bottleneck as the system scales in knowledge size or query load. By distributing storage and computation, we ensure horizontal scalability**: doubling the hardware can roughly double the capacity. This is essential for a long-lived AGI system that could accumulate knowledge indefinitely.\n\nIt‚Äôs worth noting analogies: the human brain handles real-time sensory streams by massively parallel processing and only keeping relevant signals in conscious focus ‚Äì our design similarly parallelizes graph processing and filters relevant subgraphs for the LCM. The internet itself is a gigantic graph (the World Wide Web), and search engines index it with distributed crawlers and semantic indexes ‚Äì our embedding index and distributed graph approach echo that, treating the KG as a mini-web of knowledge that can be searched both by structured queries and by semantic similarity. By combining streaming updates, in-memory speed, and intelligent retrieval and pruning, we aim for an LCN architecture that can think on its feet**: updating knowledge on the order of milliseconds, and scaling to millions of concepts without a hiccup. This lays the groundwork for an always-on, responsive AI reasoning system that can grow its knowledge continually.\nSelf-Healing and Error Mitigation in Reasoning Loops\n\nAn LCN system that builds and uses a knowledge graph on the fly must confront the issue of error accumulation**. If the LCM or any component makes a wrong inference and adds a flawed node or edge to the graph, that misinformation can propagate ‚Äì subsequent reasoning may use it and compound the mistake. Over many iterations, even a small error rate can snowball, leading the system down incorrect paths (a known problem in multi-step LLM reasoning as well). To achieve robust, human-aligned_ reasoning, the architecture should include self-healing loops** that detect and correct errors, ensuring the knowledge graph‚Äôs quality remains high. We propose the following mechanisms to handle errors and maintain coherence:\n\n- \n\nIntegrated Verification Models:** We introduce a dedicated verification sub-model** or subsystem whose sole job is to assess the correctness or consistency of newly added knowledge. After the LCM (or tool) proposes a new fact and it‚Äôs added to the graph, the verifier model takes the context and the new fact and evaluates it. This could be a smaller language model fine-tuned for truthfulness/consistency checking, or even a set of heuristic rules. For example, if the graph just added ‚ÄúParis is the capital of Germany‚Äù, a verifier (knowing geography) would flag this as likely incorrect. Verification can also involve cross-checking with external sources: the system could automatically query a trusted knowledge base (like Wikipedia or an internal ground-truth KG) to see if the statement contradicts known truth. If a mismatch is found, the system can mark that edge as ‚Äúdisputed‚Äù or even refuse to use it for further reasoning. In some cases, the verifier might try an alternate reasoning path_: e.g., ask the LCM a second time in a different way to confirm the fact, akin to double-checking work. This layered approach ‚Äì generation followed by verification ‚Äì parallels how humans write a draft then proofread it, or how software uses unit tests after writing functions. It can dramatically reduce silent error accumulation because mistakes are caught early. Of course, verification itself can err or be incomplete, but combining multiple verifiers (one symbolic, one neural) can increase reliability. For instance, a simple arithmetic checker plus a neural commonsense checker would catch different types of errors. Recent research on self-consistency in LLMs (having models vote or check answers) supports that such verification boosts accuracy‚Äãarxiv.org.\n\n- \n\nContradiction Detection and Constraint Reasoning:** As the KG grows, there may arise contradictions** ‚Äì two pieces of knowledge that cannot both be true. The system should actively monitor for this. We can borrow methods from knowledge representation: treat certain relations as logical constraints (for example, if X is a subclass of Y and Y is a subclass of X and X ‚â† Y, that‚Äôs a contradiction unless they are equal). A lightweight logic reasoner** can run in the background to detect unsatisfiable combinations or conflicting assertions. For instance, if the KG has ‚ÄúA = B‚Äù and ‚ÄúA = C‚Äù and also ‚ÄúB ‚â† C‚Äù, that‚Äôs a direct contradiction. More subtly, if it has two different values for a functional property (say two birthdates for the same person), that‚Äôs a conflict. Upon detecting a contradiction, the system can engage a resolution policy**: perhaps label both pieces as uncertain and trigger a re-examination. The LCM itself could be asked to explain the contradiction or decide which one to retract (introducing a form of debate_ between conflicting facts). We might implement a Truth Maintenance System (TMS)** similar to those in classical AI: TMS tracks dependencies of beliefs and can retract a belief when its justification fails. In an LCN, each graph edge could carry pointers to which inference led to it; if a contradiction is found, trace back and find which inference step might be the culprit, then reconsider that step (maybe by consulting a different tool or model). This way, the graph can heal** by pruning erroneous branches of reasoning. Such an approach mirrors the scientific method: identify contradictory evidence and then revisit hypotheses to resolve the inconsistency.\n\n- \n\nConfidence and Weighting of Knowledge:** Not all information in the KG should be treated equally certain. We propose assigning a confidence score to each edge** (and possibly node) in the knowledge graph. Initially, facts asserted by an uncertain process (like an LCM guess) might get a lower confidence, whereas those given by a reliable tool or externally verified get higher confidence. These confidences can be used in reasoning ‚Äì e.g., the LCM can be trained or instructed to weigh highly confident facts more heavily in its chain-of-thought, and maybe ignore or re-verify low-confidence ones. The confidence can also decay if not reinforced (see next point). When combining multiple pieces of evidence, the system can compute a combined confidence (like Bayesian updating or a voting scheme). If a reasoning result has low confidence, the system knows to double-check via another method. This approach is akin to probabilistic graphical models_ or fuzzy logic_, where each piece of knowledge has a degree of belief. Implementing a full Bayesian network on a large dynamically-created KG may be too complex, but approximate methods (like simply counting supporting vs refuting evidence) can give a useful metric. A practical use: if two nodes have contradictory info, look at their confidence ‚Äì the system might keep the higher-confidence assertion and drop the lower. Confidence-weighted edges essentially allow a graceful handling of uncertainty**, rather than a brittle true/false approach. It provides a gradient for the verifier and contradiction detector to work with: e.g., if contradiction is between a 0.9 confidence fact and a 0.4 confidence fact, likely the latter is wrong.\n\n- \n\nProvenance and Justification Tracking:** Every piece of knowledge added to the graph should carry provenance metadata** ‚Äì information about how_ or why_ it was added. This could include the source (which tool or model said it, and at which step), the input that led to it, or even a chain of reasoning justifying it. For example, an edge might have a note ‚Äúadded by LCM at step 5 based on user question and tool X‚Äôs result‚Äù. Keeping provenance enables post hoc_ analysis: if later something seems off, the system (or a developer) can trace the reasoning trail. More importantly, the system itself can use provenance to identify unreliable sources. If it notices a pattern like ‚Äúfacts from tool Y often lead to contradictions‚Äù, it can adjust by either improving that tool or using it less. Provenance tracking is common in databases and scientific knowledge bases ‚Äì our AI should similarly be introspective about its knowledge. In terms of architecture, this means the data model of the knowledge graph isn‚Äôt just a set of triples, but potentially a set of quads or annotated triples, where the annotation includes origin and confidence. When the LCM uses the KG, it can even be prompted with the provenance (‚ÄúAccording to Wikipedia, X is Y‚Äù) to increase trust or context. Provenance also helps in generating human-understandable explanations**, crucial for alignment: the system can output not just an answer but: ‚ÄúI conclude this because ‚Ä¶ [graph path] ‚Ä¶ which was found via ‚Ä¶‚Äù. This internal habit of justification makes it easier to spot errors ‚Äì if the justification is weak or circular, that‚Äôs a red flag.\n\n- \n\nForgetting and Decay Mechanisms:** We incorporate temporal decay** for knowledge that is not confirmed or used. If a piece of information sits in the KG without being referenced in any subsequent reasoning steps, its confidence can be gradually reduced. This simulates a form of forgetting_, which is actually useful to remove noise over time. The decay rate could be proportional to an uncertainty measure ‚Äì highly uncertain info decays fast (if not reconfirmed), whereas very certain core facts might never decay. Decay can also apply when contradictions arise: a disputed fact‚Äôs confidence might be reduced automatically. Moreover, if a fact keeps getting used and never leads to issues, its confidence could increase (negative decay or reinforcement). This dynamic is reminiscent of spreading activation** and decay in cognitive science models of memory: active memories stay strong, inactive ones fade. By doing this, the system naturally phases out potentially wrong information that isn‚Äôt substantiated. If it was actually important, presumably it would have come up again or been cross-checked, in which case it wouldn‚Äôt have decayed. A practical implementation might be a scheduled process that periodically lowers confidence of all facts by a small percentage, and another process that boosts confidence of facts each time they‚Äôre used in a successful reasoning. The result is a kind of evolutionary memory**: only the fittest (most consistent and useful) knowledge survives in the long run. This keeps the knowledge base from bloating with unvetted statements and reduces the chance of old errors lingering to haunt future reasoning.\n\n- \n\nFeedback Loops and Meta-Reasoning:** Finally, the architecture can allow the system to reflect on its own reasoning** periodically. After solving a problem or at checkpoints, the LCM (or a separate meta-reasoner) can be prompted to analyze the KG for coherence: e.g., ‚ÄúReview the current knowledge graph for any contradictions or irrelevant info.‚Äù This kind of prompt can leverage the LCM‚Äôs reasoning ability on a higher level, essentially turning its cognition onto itself. If it identifies something like ‚ÄúI used an assumption that might be false,‚Äù it can mark that. This self-reflection closes the loop for self-healing. It‚Äôs analogous to how humans sometimes reconsider what they ‚Äúknow‚Äù when things don‚Äôt add up, engaging in critical thinking about their own beliefs. Ensuring the architecture supports such meta-queries (the LCM being able to query the state of the KG and get a summary) is important for long-term autonomy and alignment. It also helps in aligning AI with human oversight: the system can present its self-identified doubts to human operators for guidance if needed.\n\nBy deploying these error-mitigation strategies, the LCN system becomes resilient**. Mistakes are not catastropic; they are detected and corrected, often autonomously. The knowledge graph remains a largely accurate, consistent workspace for reasoning, rather than a garbage dump of unchecked outputs. In effect, the system exhibits a form of immune system** for knowledge ‚Äì identifying foreign or harmful entries and neutralizing them, and strengthening the memory of beneficial, confirmed knowledge. This will be critical for any long-running AGI: without such measures, errors would accumulate and distort its ‚Äúbelief system.‚Äù With them, the system can maintain trustworthiness and adapt by learning from its mistakes, thus continuously improving its reasoning quality over time.\nAdvanced Graph Tooling for LCN: Beyond Neo4j and NetworkX\n\nThe final challenge is that existing graph tools may not be sufficient for the demands of LCN systems. Traditional graph databases like Neo4j or programming libraries like NetworkX were not designed with AI reasoning integration in mind. Neo4j provides ACID transactions and convenient Cypher queries, but it can be slow for real-time dynamic updates and doesn‚Äôt natively support vector operations or neural integration. NetworkX is flexible and easy, but it runs in Python memory and struggles with graphs beyond millions of nodes or with concurrent access. To support LCM-KG integration at scale, we need to enhance or replace** these tools with systems tailored for neural-symbolic workloads. Key directions include blending vector search with graph queries, integrating symbolic reasoning with differentiable functions, and optimizing for high-frequency updates. We propose the development of a custom high-performance dynamic knowledge graph engine** and discuss leveraging ideas from adjacent fields:\n\n- \n\nVector-Native Graph Databases:** We envision a new kind of graph database that treats vector embeddings as first-class citizens** alongside nodes and edges. In this system, every node can have one or multiple vector embeddings, and the DB can execute queries like ‚Äúfind nodes with embedding similar to X‚Äù or ‚Äútraverse graph, but use embedding similarity as a weighting‚Äù. This is a fusion of a vector search engine (like Pinecone, Vespa, or FAISS) with a graph store. Some modern databases are moving this direction ‚Äì for example, there are extensions of Neo4j and TigerGraph that incorporate similarity search ‚Äì but a ground-up design might be needed for full performance. Such a database could maintain HNSW indices for node embeddings, update them when embeddings change, and allow hybrid queries_: e.g., ‚ÄúMATCH (person:Person)-[:LIVES_IN]-&gt;(city) WHERE city.embedding ~ [vector]‚Äù to find people living in a city similar to a given concept. By having this built-in, the LCM could directly query the database with an embedding vector to get relevant nodes, without an external search step. This also enables semantic clustering**: the database could automatically group nodes by embedding similarity to speed up certain queries, similar to how some search engines cluster documents by topic. A vector-native graph DB would also naturally support multi-modal data ‚Äì images, audio, etc., by storing their embeddings on nodes or edges (imagine an edge embedding representing the relationship context). The benefit for LCN is seamless integration: the LCM‚Äôs language of vectors and the KG‚Äôs language of symbols converge in one place.\n\n- \n\nNeural-Symbolic Fusion Frameworks:** Another direction is to build on neurosymbolic AI frameworks** that already attempt to integrate logic with neural networks. For instance, projects like DeepMind‚Äôs Neural Tensor Networks**, or more generally neurosymbolic reasoners_, allow symbolic rules to be embedded into neural computations‚Äãarxiv.org. While many such efforts are research-stage, we can incorporate their insights. One idea is a differentiable reasoner** that sits on top of the KG: it could take a query and use both symbolic pattern matching and neural function approximation to return answers. For example, a differentiable reasoner might represent logical rules as tensors and do matrix operations to infer new relations (this has been explored in differentiable logic programming). Integrating this into our system would mean some reasoning steps can be done by gradient descent or matrix multiplication rather than backtracking search. Another relevant tool is Logic Tensor Networks** or Semantic Loss functions** in neural nets, which encode symbolic constraints (like ‚Äúif X then Y‚Äù) as terms in a loss function. We could imagine training the LCM or an adapter network with a loss that penalizes violating known logical constraints from the KG, effectively teaching the neural part to obey symbolic logic. Over time, as the LCM internalizes the KG‚Äôs ontology, the interface becomes smoother. While these approaches are experimental, our architecture should be compatible with plugging them in**. That means designing the KG engine and the LCM interface in an open, API-driven way ‚Äì so that if tomorrow a better neurosymbolic module comes (say a new GNN that can do logical reasoning), we can insert it as a component without redesign. Flexibility here is key; hence advocating for microservice modules earlier. The long-term vision is a unified neural-symbolic platform** where adding a new piece of knowledge to the graph can immediately influence the neural inference and vice versa, possibly even through end-to-end learning.\n\n- \n\nCustomized Dynamic KG Engine:** Given the unique needs, building a custom engine might be warranted. This engine would combine features: in-memory, distributed, vector-indexed, and with hooks for custom logic_. It could use a plugin architecture**: e.g., one plugin handles standard graph queries (like a Cypher execution engine), another handles vector search, another handles constraints/ontology reasoning. The engine could choose the appropriate plugin for a given query or combine them (for instance, a query that involves a neural score and a symbolic filter). By tailoring the engine for AI, we can optimize the common operations that LCN needs: frequent node insertions, on-the-fly path queries, similarity queries, and parallel access. For concurrency, it might use an actor model where each node or each partition is an actor that processes updates sequentially ‚Äì this scales well in many distributed DBs. For memory, using techniques like memory-mapped files could allow growing to huge sizes without running out of RAM (loading/unloading parts as needed). We should also incorporate time as a first-class dimension** in the engine, since knowledge updates over time (like a temporal graph). This could allow querying past states or applying time-decay easily. The engine should also support metadata per edge_ (like confidence, provenance as discussed) ‚Äì so it‚Äôs more complex than a typical triple store, but extremely useful for reasoning. Essentially we need an ‚ÄúAI brain‚Äù database**, not just a generic graph DB. There are some research systems to draw on: e.g., OpenCog‚Äôs AtomSpace** is a custom knowledge base built for AGI projects (it stores atoms of knowledge with types, and has some facilities for spreading activation). Our engine could take inspiration from such efforts and modernize them with high-performance computing techniques. By designing and open-sourcing such an engine, it could become a backbone for many neurosymbolic systems, not just our LCN ‚Äì a step toward standardizing the infrastructure for future AI.\n\n- \n\nCross-Domain Analogies:** We draw insights from adjacent fields_ to guide this tooling. In computer vision**, scene graphs_ are used to represent objects and relationships in an image. These graphs are constructed by neural detectors and used by reasoning modules (for tasks like image question answering). One observation is that scene graphs are typically small (limited by number of objects in an image) and are created anew for each scene, but they must be created very fast (in real-time for video). Researchers achieve this by highly optimized perception models that output graph components directly (e.g., a model that detects objects and predicates in one forward pass). For LCN, the parallel is to have the LCM output graph pieces directly as part of its forward pass, which we touched on with bridging networks. Also, scene graphs show how multi-modal integration can be done ‚Äì if our LCN has to incorporate vision or robotics data, we can convert those into graph form (like a robot‚Äôs world state graph) and merge with the concept graph. The control graphs in robotics** (like behavior trees or task plans) highlight the need for real-time update when the environment changes. Robotics solutions often use execution monitors_ that adjust the plan graph on the fly if assumptions fail (e.g., a planned path is blocked). We can adopt a similar idea: an execution monitor agent watching the KG and the outside environment, ready to modify the graph if something unexpected happens (kind of like our contradiction detector, but for external reality mismatches). Robotics also teaches us about hard real-time constraints** ‚Äì in safety-critical situations, decisions must be made within X milliseconds or abort. Our architecture, if used in an embedded or high-stakes scenario, might incorporate a watchdog that triggers a simplified fallback (maybe a reflex action or default response) if the reasoning takes too long. This ensures safety and responsiveness. From compilers and dataflow graphs**, we learn about optimizing and scheduling graph execution. Just as a compiler‚Äôs dataflow graph is optimized (common sub-expression elimination, dead code pruning, etc.), we can optimize the knowledge graph‚Äôs usage: eliminate redundant checks, combine nodes that always co-occur, etc. Compiler graphs also have phases of analysis that could inspire multi-phase reasoning: e.g., a quick pass to gather obvious facts, then a deeper pass for complex logic ‚Äì similar to how a compiler does parsing then optimization then codegen. We can formalize reasoning phases that transform the knowledge graph in successive stages for better results. Additionally, distributed systems** theory (consensus algorithms, eventual consistency models) can inform our approach to the KG being updated by multiple agents in parallel (the microservices architecture). For instance, using an event sourcing pattern_: every update is an event in a log, and the current graph is materialized from the log. This allows replay and auditing (helpful for provenance) and concurrent updates without conflict via CRDT as mentioned. If two branches of reasoning add conflicting info, an event sourcing approach can detect conflict at merge time and resolve via predefined rules.\n\nIn sum, moving beyond off-the-shelf graph tools is necessary to achieve the LCN vision. Our plan is to either extend them with the needed capabilities or develop a new LCN-optimized knowledge store**. By integrating vector search, allowing custom reasoning plugins, and focusing on performance and concurrency, this store becomes the backbone of the AI‚Äôs memory**. It will enable the tight coupling with LCMs that we need, while handling the load of real-time, large-scale operation. Drawing from databases, AI frameworks, and even brain-like architectures (after all, the brain‚Äôs ‚Äúdatabase‚Äù is a highly parallel graph of neurons), we aim to build an engine that can serve as the memory center of an AGI. This is a foundational investment: with a powerful knowledge base, every other component (the LCM, the tools, the controllers) can operate more effectively. It paves the way for standards and platforms that others can build on ‚Äì much like how relational databases standardized business data, a neural-symbolic knowledge store could standardize AI knowledge.\nConclusion and Vision\n\nBringing together Large Concept Models and dynamic knowledge graphs in LCN systems offers a promising path toward human-level reasoning in AI. In this report, we outlined a comprehensive architecture to overcome current limitations, addressing complexity, model performance, interface alignment, real-time scaling, error correction, and tooling. The proposed solutions paint a picture of a resilient, self-improving reasoning system**:\n\n- \n\nA modular, event-driven design ensures that adding components (new tools, sensors, or reasoning agents) remains manageable, and that the inevitable synchronization overhead is minimized by smart scheduling and memory hierarchies. The LCM and knowledge graph interact fluidly through a combination of asynchronous updates and strategic caching, analogous to efficient teamwork between brain subsystems.\n\n- \n\nThrough hybrid modeling and continual learning, the system mitigates immature LCM capabilities. It doesn‚Äôt rely on one model‚Äôs infallibility; instead it orchestrates a community of models and tools, much like an ensemble of experts, with the LCM gradually taking on more responsibility as it grows stronger. This flexible routing and training approach will allow the system to improve over time**, potentially unlocking AGI-level performance incrementally rather than in one leap.\n\n- \n\nA robust interface bridges the neural and symbolic representations: every concept can be grounded in the graph, and every graph update can be understood by the concept model. By aligning these two representations (with embedding-tagged nodes, synchronization of vector and symbolic knowledge, and differentiable memory access), the traditional gap between neural nets and knowledge bases is narrowed. The LCM+KG begins to function as one cohesive cognitive system rather than two disparate parts. This aligns with the broader trend in AI towards neuro-symbolic integration**, leveraging the strengths of both paradigms‚Äãarxiv.org.\n\n- \n\nWe emphasized real-time operation and scalability, drawing parallels to streaming data systems and distributed computing. The architecture treats knowledge as a live data stream, always updating and being processed in parallel. This means an LCN-based AI could handle continuous input (e.g., a running dialog, or real-time sensor data in a robot) and scale its knowledge to internet-level sizes. By incorporating acceleration and distributed design, we ensure that growth of knowledge or usage won‚Äôt cripple the system**. This is crucial for an AGI which might run indefinitely and accumulate vast experience.\n\n- \n\nError-handling and self-healing are first-class citizens in our design. The system not only does reasoning_, but also reflects on its reasoning_ to catch mistakes and contradictions. Such self-monitoring is a cornerstone of human intelligence (metacognition) and is key for alignment ‚Äì the AI can notice when its conclusions don‚Äôt make sense and adjust, rather than blindly going off track. Features like confidence weighting, provenance, and contradiction resolution imbue the system with a form of rational skepticism** about its own knowledge, making it far more trustworthy and stable over long-term operation.\n\n- \n\nFinally, we addressed the platform and tooling aspects. The call to go beyond Neo4j and NetworkX is a call to develop infrastructure optimized for AI reasoning**. Just as deep learning drove the creation of specialized libraries and hardware (GPU, TPU, etc.), advanced reasoning will drive new graph-based memory systems. Our plan outlines what such a system needs: a fusion of symbolic query capabilities with vector-based retrieval and learning, high concurrency, and extensibility for various reasoning plugins. Building this will likely involve a community effort and iterative refinement, but the outcome could be an ‚ÄúAI operating system‚Äù for knowledge_: a standard way for AI modules to store, share, and update information at high speed.\n\nIn a broader perspective, the integration of LCMs with knowledge graphs can be seen as mimicking the integration of different parts of the human mind: associative neural memory with structured logical memory. The strategies we propose borrow from many analogies ‚Äì the brain‚Äôs parallel distributed processing and memory consolidation, the hive mind of agents cooperating, the rigor of logical frameworks, the adaptability of evolutionary systems, and the reliability of engineered distributed systems. By synthesizing ideas from AI and other domains**, we ensure our architecture is not only technically sound but conceptually rich and future-proof.\n\nAs we implement these ideas, we should validate them incrementally. Early prototypes can be tested on complex reasoning benchmarks (like GAIA, which KGoT targeted‚Äãmedium.com) to ensure each component yields improvement ‚Äì e.g. test if the self-healing loop indeed catches errors more often than a baseline, or if the hybrid LCM/LLM approach solves more tasks than LCM alone. We should also be mindful of emergent behaviors: a system this complex might show unexpected interactions (for example, the LCM might learn to game the confidence mechanism unless properly trained). Continuous monitoring and adjustment will be needed, essentially applying our own advice of reflection to the development process.\n\nIn conclusion, the plan we set forth aims to turn the theoretical benefits of LCN (powerful reasoning at low cost) into a practical, extensible infrastructure for human-aligned AGI**. By tackling known weaknesses head-on with robust architectural patterns, we pave the way for an AI that can reason transparently (through its graphs), adapt quickly (through its modular design), and remain aligned and accurate (through its self-correction). The journey will likely involve refining each of these components as research advances, but this blueprint provides a clear starting point. If successful, the resulting system would represent a significant step towards AI that not only has knowledge, but knows how to organize, apply, and refine that knowledge in a human-like, scalable, and safe manner.\n\nSources:**\n\n- \n\nBesta, M. et al._ (2025).

Now that we have the enhanced semantic conflict detection service implemented, let's discuss the next steps to complete our AI-native Git alternative.\n\n## What We've Accomplished So Far\n\nWe've created the `semanticConflictServiceEnhanced.js` which implements a sophisticated conflict detection and resolution system tailored for AI-generated code. This service addresses one of the key points from your initial description:\n\n> \"Git was designed to track the precise history of hand-written code, but, with coding agents, that granularity becomes less meaningful.\"\n\nOur enhanced service:\n1. Uses concept graphs to understand semantic relationships between code elements \n2. Detects both direct and semantic conflicts (beyond just textual line conflicts)\n3. Provides domain-aware resolution strategies based on the context\n4. Focuses on intent and behavior rather than just text changes\n\n## Next Components to Build\n\nTo complete an AI-native version control system, we should consider building:\n\n1. **Intent Specification Tracker** - A system that stores and manages the \"prompts\" or intent specifications that generated code, rather than just the raw code itself.\n\n2. **Test-Based Validation Service** - A service that evaluates changes based on whether tests pass rather than just what code changed, addressing:\n   > \"Developers often don't audit every diff ‚Äî they just want to know whether the new behavior aligns with the intended outcome.\"\n\n3. **Agent Change Attribution System** - A component that tracks which AI agent made changes and why, with metadata about confidence levels and reasoning.\n\n4. **AI Review Integration** - Integration with AI code review tools that can assess semantic impacts rather than just syntactic changes.\n\n5. **Semantic Commit Interface** - A UI that allows developers to commit changes based on intent and behavioral outcomes rather than just file diffs.\n\n## Recommended Next Steps\n\nI recommend we focus on building the **Intent Specification Tracker** next.

One key\nchallenge standing in the way of this paradigm shift isintegration:\nhow to responsibly and verifiably integrate new information into a\nrepository of natural language [94], e.g., to update an AI agent‚Äôs\nmemory of user intent in a reviewable, concise, and accurate man-\nner, such that the memory remains aligned. How can technology\nassist with the integration of a new piece of information into an\nexisting repositoryat scale(e.g., a design document, a requirements\nlist, documentation, a wiki, novel, etc.)? The new information may\nconflict with prior information‚Äîsomething may becomeinconsis-\ntentorcontradictory. Changing existing information can incur the\nsame effect. We frame this challenge for the community asseman-\ntic conflict detectionandsemantic conflict resolution, since\nit operates at the level ofsemanticsandconcepts, unlike past tech-\nniques in software engineering and document synchronization that\noperate on pre-defined structure and syntax.\nOver brief time-frames and short documents, simple methods‚Äî\nsuch as using LLMs to regenerate entire documents or apply string\nreplace operations [54]‚Äîcan perform edits, but as humans interact\nwith agents over long time-frames and complex projects, these\nmethods cease to function at scale. Simple vector store architectures,\nseen in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), also face challenges,\nsince detecting semantic conflicts frequently requires multi-hop\nreasoning, a well-known failure mode [24,36].Howto resolve a\nconflict is also often subjective [13,48], and therefore a problem\nfor HCI, as for example, particular conflict resolutions may incur\ncascadeswhere solving one problem creates another. Systems thus\nneed ways not only ofidentifyingconflicts and inconsistencies\nefficiently and accurately at scale, but ofinteractively assisting users\nin conflict resolutionin a way that a) helps users reflect and b) foresee\nthe impact of changes, c) only makes the necessary changes without\ntouching other information, and d) minimizes user effort while\nmaximizing changes‚Äô alignment with user intent. Downstream AI\nsystems could use conflict detection results to, e.g., decide whether\nto perform grounding acts [85,87] such as request for clarification.\nTo help researchers better understand the problem of updating\nAI memory of user intent in an aligned manner, in this paper, we\nprovide several contributions to the literature. We:\n(1)Define the termintent specificationto name grounding doc-\numents that coordinate with AI agents, such as user-defined\n‚Äúmemory‚Äù lists for Claude Code [2].\n(2)Provide design goals for AI-assisted interfaces for semantic\nconflict detection and resolution, inspired by related literature\nsuch as impact analysis in software engineering.\n(3)Develop an interface,SemanticCommit, iterating its design\nover two pilot studies. Our system implements a range of af-\nfordances for conflict detection and resolution and is intended\nas a probe of user behavior.\n(4)\nIntroduce an architecture for semantic conflict detection at\nscale. Our approach uses induced knowledge graphs, adapt-\ning emerging architecture in retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG) [36]. To test and compare our approach to prior ap-\nproaches in the literature, we also provide a custom benchmark\non intent specifications across several settings.\n(5)\nProvide empirical insights from a within-subjects user study,\nexamining how users detect, understand, and resolve conflicts\nwhen updating intent specifications for AI memory, comparing\nSemanticCommitto OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT Canvas.\nOur findings suggest that AI agent interfaces should enable users\nto performimpact analysis, separating retrieval from generation‚Äî\nsteps that are currently conflated in many AI-powered software\nengineering IDEs. Surprisingly, although users appeared more en-\ngaged when usingSemanticCommit, they did not report signifi-\ncantly higher workload than the more automated Canvas UI. This\nsuggests thatthe benefits of improved control can offset the\ncost of manual review,possibly by shifting user workload away\nfrom metacognitive demands [90] that users face when prompting\nin open-ended chat, towards the demands of the actual task, such\nas reviewing conflicts.\n2  Motivation: Intent Specifications Ground\nHuman Coordination with AI Agents\nHumans are increasingly managing and validating the outputs of\nAI systems that implement entire software systems like games,\nwebsites, and apps. To reduce risk and align AI decision-making\nin user preferences, human-readable documents are emerging as a\nmechanism to create and maintain common ground [18] between\nhumans and AI systems acting on their behalf.\nNumerous examples are emerging of this interaction paradigm.\nThe AI-powered programming IDE Cursor, for instance, can ground\nits behavior in user-made ‚Äúcursor rules‚Äù‚Äîmarkdown documents\nthat AIs read to ground their behavior in user preferences‚Äîat both\nproject-specific and global levels [21].\n1\nRules range from sweep-\ning commands, like ‚Äúnever use apologies,‚Äù to the highly particular,\nlike ‚Äúuse vectorized operations in pandas and numpy for improved\nperformance.‚Äù Users develop these rules over time across many\ninteractions. Anthropic has also adopted this paradigm: with the\nClaude Code agent, users createCLAUDE.mdfiles listing project- and\nglobal-level directives; Anthropic‚Äôs own ‚Äúmemory best practices‚Äù\ntell users to format memories as ‚Äúbullet points‚Äù and reminds them\nto manually ‚Äúupdate memories as your project evolves‚Äù [2]. These\n‚Äúmemories‚Äù help Claude Code ‚Äúremember project conventions, ar-\nchitecture decisions, or coding standards that we want to reference\nacross sessions‚Äù [98]. Not to be outdone, the CEO of Windsurf‚Äîa\ncompetitor to Cursor‚Äîjust announced a yet-to-be-implemented\n‚Äúauto-generated memories‚Äù feature where these memories of user\n1\nPeople have started crowd-source these rules: the ‚ÄúAwesome CursorRules‚Äù repository\nand CursorList.com include hundreds of rules lists, contributed by everyday users,\nindexed by programming language, libraries, and use cases. See, e.g., https://github.\ncom/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules.\n2\n\nSemantic Commit: Helping Users Update Intent Specifications for AI Memory at Scale\nFigure 2: A high-level depiction of our envisioned interaction\nbetween humans and AI assistants for long-term projects.\nThe human-readableintent specificationserves as an inter-\nmediate layer for enhancing common ground between the\nhuman and the AI, and grounds the AI‚Äôs decision-making.\nWe assume future AI agents will have a similar intent spec-\nification layer. Our project squarely concerns how the AI\nupdatesthis memory in a robust, verifiable manner, and in\nthe process might surface conflicts to the user to get their\nfeedback in resolving them.\nintent are automatically updated by an AI, which will inevitably\nencounter the very challenges we discuss here.\n2\nEveryday users are also increasingly coordinating with AI sys-\ntems through lists of requirements expressed in natural language.\nFor instance, users are generating games from specs that resemble\nlists of software requirements. Here is an excerpt from a real user,\n3\nto give readers a sense of how these rules appear in practice:\n‚Ä¢The dog barks when the player clicks or taps on the screen,\nmaking the sheep move faster\n‚Ä¢Sheep should react realistically to the dog‚Äôs presence\n‚Ä¢When frightened, the flock should scatter\nThis user‚Äôs example, which in total has 27 requirements, is only\nthestartof an interaction with an AI agent. As the user interacts\nand projects grow in complexity, future AI systems will need to\nassist in the extension and updating of these rules and details.\nWe call these lists‚Äîcursorrules,CLAUDE.mdfiles, user directives,\nAI memory of user intent, etc.‚Äîintent specifications, adapting\nand broadening the notion ofrequirement specificationsin software\nengineering. Intent specifications areevolving, comprehensible\ndocuments of user intent that ground AI decision-making and\nreify common ground between humans and AI systems. We in-\ntroduceintent specificationto underscore that such documents may\nnot only cover design details or software requirements, but how the\nAI should communicate to the user, who the user is, the user‚Äôs goals\nand dreams, etc. Said differently, an intent specification is not only\na description of user intent, but may also include information that\nhelps an AI agentassumeuser intent‚Äîi.e., background, assumed\n2\nhttps://x.com/vitrupo/status/1900146068030914740\n3\nhttps://github.com/vnglst/when-ai-fails/blob/main/shepards-dog/README.md\npreferences‚Äîaccelerating the establishment of common ground.\nHowever, unlike a general memory store‚Äîwhich could be an ex-\ntensive collection of all interactions‚Äîintent specifications‚Äô purpose\nis to be reviewable, comprehensible and digestible, to be inspected\nand edited by humans. In response to edits, the AI will adjust its be-\nhavior, such as revising an implementation; the AI may also amend\nthe specification in response to the user or to better reflect new\nimplementation details and assumptions [94, 101] (Fig. 2).\nAs we mention in our introduction, theintegrationof new infor-\nmation into an intent specification is not (always) straightforward.\nPeople and ideas change. New information may conflict with prior\ninformation, especially as projects and user interactions stretch\nfrom days to months and years. Proposed approaches to memory\nwith RAG architectures, which store all memories verbatim, do not\naccount for these potential conflicts (e.g., [1, 44, 76]).\nOur chief insight here that integration of new information is a\nprocessthat can requireinteractive, human-in-the-loop feedback\nfor aligned resolution. Both users and AI systems need support for\nsemantic conflictdetection‚Äîto understand when a conflict has taken\nplace, with what information, and how‚Äîas well asresolution, as\nresolving conflicts could involve the revision, addition, or deletion\nof existing information in a manner that may add or change details.\nTo resolve conflicts, practical assistance may requireclarification\nof ambiguities,constructive negotiation of ideas[94], ordelegation\nof tasks[89,101]. However, it remains unclear how users update,\nand want to update, intent specifications in practice.What affor-\ndances should AI memory interfaces have for the process\nof integration? How do users think about semantic conflicts\nand what needs do they have for resolving them with confi-\ndence? How can we help users update intent specifications\nlikeCLAUDE.mdfiles with confidence?\nBefore returning to these questions with our system design and\nuser study, we first connect to existing literature that can help shed\nlight on this emerging paradigm.\n2.1  Related Work\n2.1.1Design documents to coordinate work in human teams.\nThe rise of intent specifications mirrors what human teams already\ndo to coordinate actions. Across many domains‚Äîfrom product\ndesign, to game development, software engineering, UX design,\nconstruction, and animation‚Äîpeople standardize the vision (look,\nfeel, goals, plans, etc) of a project in documents that are often called\n‚Äúdesign documents‚Äù [10]. These documents serve to establish and\nmaintaincommon groundbetween parties [18], ensuring each mem-\nber‚Äôs independent actions remaingroundedin shared understanding\nand objectives. In animation, the design document takes the form\nof model sheets [68], which standardize how to draw characters\nand other assets. Game developers use ‚Äúgame design documents‚Äù\n(GDDs) to keep development grounded across a team [19]. In soft-\nware engineering (SE) and UX research, need-finding studies and\nclient discussions produce a ‚Äúsystem requirements specification‚Äù\nthat is passed off to the software team [38,61]. Programmers de-\nvelop ‚Äúcoding style guides,‚Äù or norms around naming conventions,\ncomments, and writing tests, as well as ‚Äúcontributing guidelines‚Äù\nthat establish expectations and rules for external contributors. In\nall cases these documents serve to externalize, standardize, and\n3\n\nVaithilingam et al.\ncoordinate the high-levelintentof a team‚Äîits objectives, details,\nprocedures, and feel‚Äîand are revised as the project proceeds [19].\nIntent specifications, while less formal than code, are a lot like\nsoftware: they encode dependencies among ideas that constrains\nfuture evolution. These dependencies may be ‚Äúsequential‚Äù (i.e., a\ncustom term is defined then used later on) or heterarchical. As\nprojects continue, teams ‚Äúcommit‚Äù new information to the intent\nspecification, and must resolve outdated or inconsistent depen-\ndencies. Maintaining consistency is paramount, because the very\npurpose of these documents isto enforce consistency and define\nstandards. For instance, from a study of game designers:‚Äú[She]\nwrites the GDD as she is designing the game... taking anything out\nof... the GDD thatconflictwith theconsistencyof her plot. [She]...\nwrote her entire GDD... as a list, which she frequentlyaddedand\ndeletedfrom as she designed the game‚Äù[19, p.9]. The field of re-\nquirements engineering in SE also stresses the importance of clarity,\nconciseness, completeness, and unambiguous requirements [23],\nwith ‚Äúcommission (inclusion of irrelevant or incorrect details) and\nomission (exclusion of necessary details)‚Äù additional concerns [64].\nCurrently, for updatingunstructureddocuments, there is no way\nfor those committing changes to see thesemanticramifications of\ntheir changes on the rest of the document. An example is editing\na scene in a novel: would changing a lunch between two charac-\nters to a dinner setting impact something hundreds of pages later?\nThese aresemantic conflictsthat must bedetectedandresolved\nto proceed with confidence. In software engineering, visibility on\nthe ramifications of a feature change or addition is calledimpact\nanalysis: identifying what parts of the shared context (code repos-\nitory) will need to be amended, for the change to occur [6]. Note\nthat impact analysis is asense-makingtask, less a coding one: it is\nmore about estimating time and resources required to perform a\nchange, than it is about helping the team actually perform it.\n2.1.2Human-AI Collaboration Grounded in Shared, Inter-\nmediate Representations.HCI has, in a sense, always been about\ncommunicating to machines through shared representations [4,40].\nHowever, past shared representations had to be strictly formalized‚Äî\ninto programming languages, domain-specific languages (DSLs),\nschema, etc.‚Äîto ensure deterministic outcomes. These shared repre-\nsentations helped negotiate agency between humans and machines\n[39], but ultimately could only go so far, as end-users always re-\nsigned some agency to the representation designer(s) [56, 94].\nToday with LLMs, we are less limited by this constraint, and\nsolutions to the problem of human-machine communication might\nbe better found in cybernetics theory [9] than static formalism.\nEffective  human-AI  communication  relies  upon  tight  feedback\nloops [101], but also offering humanscontrolin the form of trans-\nparency over AI understanding and context. Along these lines,\nemerging HCI research envisions that AI systems will be grounded\nby shared representations of a more informal nature‚Äîlists of direc-\ntives expressed in natural language [64,94,101]. Some researchers\neven argue that these informal expressions of intention will be ‚Äúall\nyou need‚Äù [81,83]. For instance, Vaithilingam et al. imagine a hy-\npothetical AI game design assistant where the AI ‚Äú[integrates user]\nchoices into the project plan‚Äù [94], while Zamfirescu et al. explore\nan iterative design loop with an AI agent that ‚Äútracks decisions\nthat the human has made‚Äù and ‚Äúsurfaces decisions the LLM has\nimplemented in the code‚Äù in a running list [101]. Ma et al. define\n‚Äúrequirement-oriented prompt engineering,‚Äù helping users generate\na ‚Äúclear, complete requirements‚Äù list prior to prompting an AI to\nimplement software. They stress that making a good list requires\nskill and support [64]. These projects speak to the need for tar-\ngeted support for updating intent specifications that ground AI\nbehavior. Ensuring alignment with user intent (e.g., by reducing\ninconsistencies) is critical: miscommunications are the chief reason\nfor breakdowns with AI agents [89], and the probability of fail-\nure compounds as communication continues without addressing\nmisunderstandings [87].\n2.1.3Conflict detection and resolution techniques and in-\nterfaces.Conflict detection and resolution are classic problems in\ncomputing, usually arising in contexts of collaborative information\nprocessing to merge asynchronous changes. Engineers have devel-\noped techniques such as version control [25,69], groupware plat-\nforms and database synchronization [53,58,77], and concurrency-\ncontrol systems [25,37]. The ‚Äògit‚Äò command-line interface [32], for\ninstance, is a popular version control system where users make\n‚Äúcommits‚Äù‚Äîa change to a file repository, alongside a pithy message‚Äî\nto keep track of changes. Conflict management systems now extend\nto nearly all collaborative computing settings, such as document\nediting with Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) [53,58].\nMany text interfaces that support conflict detection and reso-\nlution visualize differences between versions as ‚Äúdiffs‚Äù [46]. Diff\nvisualizations usuallycrossoutdeletedinformationinredand\nshowcasechangesoradditionsingreenunderline, a colored ver-\nsion of the method originally proposed by Neuwirth et al. [70]. The\nvisualization has been extended and applied in other ways [73,82];\nfor instance, when merging branches of a code repository, program-\nming IDEs show ‚Äúmerge conflicts‚Äù in-line as highlighted segments\nof code. Recently, Ink&Switch‚Äôs Patchwork project [59] explores\ngeneralizations of the diff, including summary and diagram diffs.\nDiffs are now being used to showcase edits made by AI. Numer-\nous tools have recently been developed to enhance writing work-\nflows with LLMs, spanning various areas such as story writing [16,\n17,100], screenplay writing [67], poetry [31], dictation [57], and\nargumentative [96,102] and scientific [28] writing.InkSync[54],\nfor example, is a prototype for executable and verifiable text editing\nwith LLMs, which shows LLM edits as diffs on the document. To\nmake diffs,InkSyncuses string-matching: it relies upon the LLM to\nreproduce extracts of text to change, and then specify the replace-\nment text; this method is also used by Anthropic Artifacts [79].\nHowever, there is a limit to which this past work can inform our\nsituation. The above situations and techniquesassume the updated\ndocument. That is, the updated document is a given, and the system\nneeds to detect changes and visualize them to the user.\nWhen making semantic commits,we do not have, or cannot\nassume, the updated document as a ground truth. Semantic\nconflict resolution interfaces must therefore go further‚Äînot just\nvisualizing what changesweremade, but what changescould be\nmade,wherethey should be made, andwhat the effectsmight be.\nWherediffinterfaces provide feedback, semantic diff interfaces\nmust offer feedforward: affordances that help the user foresee what\nthe result of an action may be [66,95]. This new situation resembles\n4\n\nSemantic Commit: Helping Users Update Intent Specifications for AI Memory at Scale\n‚Äúimpact analysis‚Äù in software engineering [29], but here we cannot\nassume well-structured data like a programming language.\n2.1.4Natural  Language  Inference,  Reference  Ambiguity,\nand Knowledge Graphs.Finally, the technical side of our work\nrelates  to  natural  language  inference  (NLI),  a  research  area  in\nNLP [48] that concerns the classification task: Given two sentences‚Äî\na premise sentence and a hypothesis‚Äìdoes the hypothesis sentence\nfollow from (entailment),contradict, or bear aneutralrelationship to\nthe premise? HCI scholars have applied NLI to data annotation [97],\nin-situ summaries [60], and LLM response consistency [15]. Our\ndiscussion of NLI provides additional context for our system design.\nDetecting conflicts is by no means an objective task; human anno-\ntators frequently disagree [13,48]. Jiang & de Marneffe investigated\nreasons for human disagreement during NLI classification [48] and\nargue for a fourth category, ‚Äúcomplicated,‚Äù which increased model\nrecall. Their goal was ‚Äúnot necessarily to maximize accuracy. A\nmodel that can recall the possible interpretations is preferred to a\nmodel that misses them‚Äù [48, p. 1365]. Chen et al. [13] also intro-\nduced a fourth category, ‚Äúambiguous,‚Äù to denote situations where\n‚Äúit is unclear whether the claim and the evidence refer to the same\ncontext... [i.e.,] there exist multiple possible assignments or interpre-\ntations.‚Äù The authors refer to this asreference ambiguity‚Äîwhen\nthe two sentencescouldcoexist, but it is unclear‚Äîand found that it\nexplained many annotator disagreements [13].\nNLI appears in recent discussions on the future of SE, which\npropose that LLMs may be used for formal requirements analy-\nsis [7,91]. A few benchmarking studies test this hypothesis; e.g.,\nLubos et al. [63] studied how LLMs can provide quality feedback\non requirements, while Fantechi et al. [26] analyze an LLM‚Äôs abil-\nity to detect inconsistencies. Importantly, Fantechi et al.‚Äôs method\nsimply fed in the entire list into the LLM and asked it to detect\nconflicts; they found that LLMs could only process ‚Äúshort require-\nment documents‚Äù this way, with performance falling off quickly for\nlonger ones. They conclude that despite lower accuracy compared\nto humans, ‚Äúmanual detection of inconsistencies is more expensive,‚Äù\ngrowing quadratically with list size, ‚Äúwhereas examining [LLM]\nanswers to distinguish true from false positives is a much lighter\ntask‚Äù [26, p. 338]. Fazelnia et al. [27] also trained an NLI model to\nanalyze requirements lists, and concluded that NLI models suffered\nspecifically in multi-hop conflict detection.\nTo better capture dependencies among requirements, researchers\nstudying requirements engineering in SE proposed ontology ex-\ntraction, where a system generates a knowledge graph (alterna-\ntively called a web ontology [3]) with nodes for entities and edges\nfor relationships between them. For instance, Hsieh et al. [45] ex-\ntract a domain-specific ontology by mining information from text-\nbooks (analogous to inductive coding). Most relevant is research\nthat explores mapping formal software requirements as knowledge\ngraphs [23], a method introduced by Kaiya and Saeki [49]. The au-\nthors use a web ontology as a visualization technique to help SWEs\nin writing more ‚Äúcorrect,‚Äù ‚Äúcomplete,‚Äù ‚Äúconsistent,‚Äù and ‚Äúunambigu-\nous‚Äù software requirements [23]. Such graph-based visualizations\nhave also supported impact analysis; for instance,Wolf[29] shows\nthe impact of proposed changes via a dependency graph. This work\ninformed our decision to use knowledge graphs (Section 5).\n3  Design Goals for Interfaces for Semantic\nConflict Detection and Resolution\nHere we chronicle our initial design goals forSemanticCommit,\nas well as our revised goals as the result of two pilot studies.\nWe wanted to design a prototype to better understand what in-\nterface affordances users need to facilitate robust and trustworthy\nupdates to intent specifications in a manner that 1) maintained\ntheir alignment with user intent and 2) kept unrelated information\nuntouched. We thus went for a kitchen-sink approach: to include a\nvariety of features that users may, or may not, choose to engage in,\nthat seemed reasonable based on past conflict resolution interfaces,\nand observe what features users find most important and how they\nuse these features in concert. Based on our review of past literature\non conflict detection, resolution, and AI-assisted writing, we identi-\nfied an initial set of design requirements forSemanticCommit:\n‚Ä¢Foresee impact: Users should be able to performsemantic\nimpact analysis‚Äîforesee the potential impact of a change,\nwithout actually making any changes [6, 29].\n‚Ä¢Detect conflicts: The system should help the userdetectpoten-\ntial conflicts or contradictions, between existing information\nand the new information being introduced.\n‚Ä¢Understand conflicts: The system should help the userunder-\nstandthe reason for conflicts, to reduce cognitive load.\n‚Ä¢Leave non-conflicting information unchanged: Integrating\nnew information should only touch pieces of information that\nare in conflict, and leave others unchanged.\n‚Ä¢Support local changes: Users should be able to inspect pro-\nposed changes in situ and decide whether to accept, reject, or\nfurther revise (such as via a ‚Äúdiff‚Äù view).\n‚Ä¢Assist conflict resolution: The system should help users re-\nsolve conflicts at both global (i.e., entire document) and local\nlevels. The AI should suggest possibleresolution strategies.\n‚Ä¢Revert changes: Proposed changes (edits) should be able to\nbe reverted at global and local levels (i.e., to cancel specific\nrevisions or back out from a wide-scale change).\n‚Ä¢Edit manually at any time: Users should be able to manually\nedit or add information at any time, should they choose.\n‚Ä¢Work at scale: The system should work at scale, i.e., for lengthy\nintent specifications, without introducing latency. The user\nshould not have to worry about document length.\nNote that there are other design goals which are important to\ngeneraluser interfaces for managing AI memory‚Äîsuch as version\ncontrol, branching, and navigation (seeMemolet[99])‚Äîbut we do\nnot consider them here.\n4\nIt‚Äôs critical to note that while some design goals overlap with\ndocument editing interfaces,a primary goal of our research is to\nproduce design implications for situations where there may be no\nmanual document view‚Äîe.g., situations where the user is commu-\nnicating entirely through a chat UI, where the AI is managing the\nintent specification for them and may surface conflicts in a different,\nconstrained manner (and decide whether, when, and how to do so).\nWe intend that semantic commit will eventually bea programmatic\nAPIfor helping developers update intent specifications that ground\n4\nIn particular, in real-life intent specifications like Cursor Rules, users sometimes\ngroup lines together; we chose a simple list to avoid complexity in our initial design.\n5\n\nVaithilingam et al.\nAI agent systems. Thus, we designed our interface to purposefully\nconstrain editing to separate pieces of information‚Äî‚Äúmemories,‚Äù\ndetails or rules‚Äîrather than enabling the user to perform freeform\nwriting tasks (i.e., think OpenAI ChatGPT‚Äôs memory store [75],\nrather than Microsoft Word).\n3.1  Early Prototype and Pilot Feedback\nOur explorations went through substantial iterations and prompt\nprototyping over a period of eight months, evolving in response to\ntwo pilot studies and progressing from a card-based interface to a\nlist of texts. We chronicle our early design and formative studies.\nFrom our design goals, we built an initial prototype, where pieces\nof information were written on cards akin to post-its and could be\nfreely moved. This interface was limited to prompting our conflict\ndetection feature, and studied how users would integrated changes\ninto (a chunked version of) the game design document for the\nunpublished LucasArts game Labyrinth [30]. In this early prototype,\ncards were only marked as either in conflict or not.\nWe ran one pilot study with five users of our card-based interface,\nand a second with four users of a revised interface. Key takeaways:\n‚Ä¢The color-coding of cards marked as conflicts drew user atten-\ntion sometimes entirely away from manual inspection of non-\nmarked cards. Possibly in reaction, all pilot userspreferred\nhigher recall over precision. They viewed false negatives\n(missed detections of true conflicts) as catastrophic, while false\npositives were easily handled with a quick skim.\n‚Ä¢When asked, participants expressed a preference for astruc-\ntured, sequential document view,over the cards interface.\nOne reason may be that users became fixated on sorting the\ncards, another could be that documents are more familiar.\n5\n‚Ä¢Users wanted finer-grained insight into thedegree of conflict.\nUsers wanted a quick visual way to understand where they\nshould spend their limited attention.\n‚Ä¢Participants woulditerate on their promptsto the conflict\ndetector and resolver, in case the output did not exactly match\ntheir intent. It seemed less important that AI sometimes made\nmistakes, and more that they were easily fixable.\n‚Ä¢In post-interviews, users suggested thatthe degree to which\nthey trusted the AI depends on their degree of investment\nin the information. If they felt invested, they would trust the\nAIlessto make direct changes.\nIn response, we added more design goals to our initial list:\n‚Ä¢Recall-first: Favor recall over precision for conflict detection.\n‚Ä¢\nList view: The system should prefer more standard document\nviews, which present manageable chunks of information se-\nquentially, than open-ended diagramming canvases.\n‚Ä¢Visualize degree: The system should help users understand\nthe degree or importance of a conflict at a glance.\n‚Ä¢Help user recover from AI errors[71]: The system should\nsupport fast iteration, in case of AI mistakes, by allowing the\nuser to steer the detector or resolver with a prompt.\nBased on these goals and feedback, we adjusted our interface\nand study protocol. The most important change we made was how\n5\nThis preference seems to map to the ‚Äúcursorrules‚Äù-like situations of editing Markdown\ndocuments, which weren‚Äôt popular at the time of our pilot.\nstrict our conflict detection retriever and filtering prompt was:\nwe loosened it considerably, to enhance recall at the expense of\nprecision. We also added a third classification, ‚Äúambiguous,‚Äù to\nimply a lesser ‚Äúdegree‚Äù of conflict, a decision solidified after review\nof papers in NLI [13,48]. Ambiguous conflicts appear as a softer\npink color to imply reduced importance, directness, or confidence\nthat the information is truly in conflict.\n6\nThis prompt engineering\nwas a delicate balance: too restrictive and the system tends to only\nrarely include ambiguous options; too generic and it flags almost\nall pieces of information as potentially conflicting. We iterated on\nour system decision choices with more confidence by validating\nchanges against custom benchmarks, which we discuss in Section 5.\n4SemanticCommitUser Interface\nHere we overview our final design and walkthrough examples of\nusage. Figure 1 shows our prototype, with global operations:\n‚Ä¢\nThe Check for Conflicts button provides the\nability to performimpact analysis[6], which only highlights\npotential conflicts without suggesting changes, allowing the\nuser to get a sense of how much effort a change might require.\nThey may choose to manually resolve each conflict, or back out\nand decide upon a different course of action.\n‚Ä¢The Makes Changes button performs Check for\nConflicts then lets the AI propose a rewrite. The back-end uses\nthe same procedure as check for conflicts, then performs a\nglobal rewrite of all detected conflicts in order to incorporate\nnew information. Critically, the LLM can decide not to rewrite\ninformation, even after it has been flagged (this is to avoid\nredundant changes); flagged conflicts that were not changed\nremain highlighted for human review.\n‚Ä¢The Add Info button allows the user to manually add a piece\nof information.\nMore features are shown in Fig. 1. Local conflict resolution op-\ntions include letting the AI rewrite, steering a rewrite, applying\na suggested resolution strategy, reverting a change, and deleting\nthe information. Global conflict resolution options complement\nthis, allowing the user to steer a global rewrite via a prompt or\nchoose a suggested resolution strategy. Users can also perform\nglobal actions to Revert All proposed changes, or Clear All Con-\nflicts (putting all pieces of information back into a neutral state).\nFinally, redunderlines are an experimental feature that suggests\nwords which contributed the most to the conflict (in Fig. 1, ‚Äúpri-\nmary‚Äù is bold-underlined to imply that nuts are likely no longer\nthe primary collectible when the player is a fox).\nThe only feature missing from our figure is a ‚Äúrequest intent\nclarification‚Äù pop-up that appears when the AI classifies a user\nrequest as potentially resulting in many changes (Section 4.1.3). We\nobserved that high-impact changes, like changing a game‚Äôs setting\nfrom Mars to Venus, could incur many second-order effects and\ndeserves an additional clarification round before proceeding with\n(relatively more costly) conflict detection.\n7\n6\nAs we rely upon LLMs, this is not an exact science. Indeed, the aforementioned NLI\npapers also show that even with human annotators, there is little consistent reason\nwhy something is categorized as ‚Äúambiguous‚Äù or ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù [13, 48].\n7\nOur prompt to the AI for this step is simple and more of a prototype: here, we simply\nfeed the entire context in alongside the user‚Äôs change, and ask the AI to provide a\nquestion if it decides the change is high-impact enough to deserve clarification.\n6\n\nSemantic Commit: Helping Users Update Intent Specifications for AI Memory at Scale\n3. Upon hover, shows \nreason for conflict\n1. User provides new \ninformation and clicks \nMake Change\n2. AI suggests changes to \nhighly conflicting items, \nleaves others for review\n4. User clicks to perform \na local rewrite\n5. To finalize conflict resolution, \nuser manually .... resolves items \nand/or clicks Clear All Conflicts\nFigure 3: Example of ourSemanticCommitworkflow, showing one process of integrating new information into an AI memory\nof the financial habits of a South Korean student. 1. The user has described a new piece of information and pressed Make\nChange. 2.SemanticCommitdetects conflicts and suggests changes to items it deems the most conflicting, leaving other\nconflicts for human review. 3. The user hovers over conflicting items to view the AI‚Äôs reasoning. 4. For one item, they click a\nbutton to let the AI make a local rewrite. The user can continuing editing, manually revising, reverting suggested changes, or\ndeleting items at will. 5. When they feel done, they manually resolve items and/or clear remaining conflicts with a global action.\n(Alternatively, the user could have clicked Check for Conflicts to only perform detection, then handled conflicts locally.)\n4.1  Walkthrough of usage\nLet‚Äôs walk through three examples of system usage in different\ndomains: an investment advisor agent, updating the directives for\nan AI software engineer, and updating a game design document.\n4.1.1Updating Memory of an Investment Advice Agent.As\na simple example, imagine an AI agent for investment advice has\naccumulated a memory of the user, a South Korean college student,\nafter many chat sessions. These include details such as financial\ngoals, life events, employment history, etc. Now this user invests\nin a cryptocurrency and expresses excitement about diversifying\nmore assets into crpyto. UsingSemanticCommit, we add this piece\nof information to the list, and the system detects potential semantic\nconflicts which may require human review (Figure 3). A user clicks\nthe ‚ÄúMake Change‚Äù button, which adds a new piece of information\n(deducing that it should do so, which is not always done), detects\nconflicts, then proposes changes to ensure the memory remains\nconsistent with the new information. One line it proposes deleting\nentirely, another it rewrites, and others it flags for review.\nNotice how semantic conflict detection leveraged the LLM‚Äôs\ngeneral knowledge: a mention that the user likes Warren Buffet‚Äôs\ninvestment strategies is highlighted as a potential conflict. Buffet, a\nfamous investor, avoids cryptocurrencies and has declared them ‚Äúrat\npoison squared‚Äù [52]. Clicking the Let AI Propose Change button\non thelocalinformation, a slight rewrite is proposed where the\nclaim is softened (Step 4 in Fig. 3).\n4.1.2Updating Rules for an AI Software Engineer.Consider\na user has a list of Cursor Rules, describing how an AI software\nengineering agent should behave in a code repository (Figure 4).\n(Here we use real cursor rules adapted fromInstructorAPI‚Äôs\nopen-source repository [47].) The user adds a new directive, com-\nmon to software engineering practice: ‚ÄúTo keep history linear and\nclean, always squash your commits before pushing a feature branch.‚Äù\nSemanticCommithighlights ‚ÄúKeep commits focused on a single\nchange‚Äù in red, indicating direct conflict, and ‚ÄúIf the feature is very\nFigure 4: Cursor Rules [92] adapted from the Instructor li-\nbrary [47], loaded into ourSemanticCommitUI. The user\nhas added a new directive to squash commits before pushing\na feature branch. The system adds the new rule to the top,\nmakes a clarifying revision, and flags other lines as potential\nconflicts. One change is in error, which the user can quickly\nspot and revert.\nlarge, create a temporary `todo.md`‚Äù in pink, indicating an ambigu-\nity. The first is unclear how to resolve: removing it seems unwise,\nbut keeping it unchanged incurs confusion. The AI has also added\na mention of squashing commits, after the line, ‚ÄúWhen being asked\nto make new features, make sure that you check out from main a\nnew branch and make incremental commits.‚Äù\n4.1.3Changing a Game Design Document.Finally, imagine\na game designer has a design document for a game set on Mars,\nwhich an AI agent implements. After some playtesting, they decide\nthat Mars is overused in sci-fi narratives, and communicate that\nthey want to switch the setting to Venus. Here, the AI has estimated\nthat the change is significant enough to request further clarification\nfrom the user before continuing:\n7\n\nVaithilingam et al.\nThe user provides clarification, and conflict detection proceeds.\nThe AI makes the most obvious changes‚Äîchanging the term ‚ÄúMars‚Äù\nto ‚ÄúVenus,‚Äù mainly‚Äîwhile flagging other potential conflicts for\nreview. A subtle semantic conflict, that Mars has sandstorms but\nVenus does not, is detected and changed to a more generic ‚Äústorm‚Äù,\nsteered by the user‚Äôs clarification:\nThese examples illustrate that conflicts: a) may require general\nworld-knowledge to detect, b) may be hard to resolve, and c)how\nto resolve a conflict can be a matter of creative decision-making.\nResolving even a single change accurately is important, as unre-\nsolved conflicts can cascade as more changes are made. Using this\nsystem, we alsolearnedwhy some conflicts occur‚Äîthe Buffett ex-\nample above was not something we were aware of‚Äîor could be\nforced to reckon with second-order effects, such as re-thinking the\nsandstorm mechanic to better fit the planetary conditions of Venus.\nNote finally that our systemdoesmay mistakes‚Äîconflicting in-\nformation can be missed, as our benchmarking shows; conflict\ndetection and retrieval are stochastic; reasoning can sometimes be\nsuperfluous; and in practice, some knowledge base domains can\nbenefit from adding a temporal feature to information (i.e., a limited\nduration where a rule holds). However, we believed the system was\nstrong enough to run a user study in order to better understand\nwhere further efforts should be directed.\n4.2  Implementation\nThe UI ofSemanticCommitis implemented in React and Type-\nScript, with a Flask Python backend for our knowledge graph-\nbased retrieval architecture (described in Section 5). We iterated on\nprompts using ChainForge [5] by setting up an evaluation pipeline\nagainst our benchmarks, which allowed us to observe the effects\nof prompt changes and model choices. There aremanyprompt-\nbased functions inSemanticCommit, from the user intent router,\nto conflict detection, local and global revision, underlining ‚Äúhighly\nconflicting‚Äù words, and suggesting resolution strategies. We chose\nGPT-4o for performance and latency reasons, as it performed opti-\nmally against our benchmarks. Further details on our development\nprocess and system are provided in Supplementary Material.\n5  Back-End for Semantic Conflict Detection\nWe implement a back-end system to drive the interface ofSeman-\nticCommit. The back-end‚Äôs primary goal is to enable conflict res-\nolution at scale. During early prototyping, we found that simple\nmethods‚Äîgiving the entire context to the LLM, or generating string-\nreplace operations [54]‚Äîwere prone to missing conflicts. These\ntechniques rely on a single prediction, which takes as input the\nentire memory store and produces as output either a reformulated\nversion or a set of suggested edits. Simple methods like rewriting\nthe entire document frequently introduced superfluous changes,\nunrelated to conflict resolution, take a substantial input context,\nand can have large latency due to output sizes.\nTo tackle the aforementioned limitations, we implement the back-\nend using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach [36]\nconsisting of two phases: pre-processing and inference. The pre-\nprocessing phase constructs aknowledge graph(KG) by extracting\nentities from a collection of input documents in the memory store\nand linking them. Each of the entities keeps track of the relevant\ndocument from which it was extracted. The inference phase detects\nsemantic conflicts using a multi-stage information retrieval (IR)\npipeline. The IR pipeline takes as input an edit action, whether it is\nan insertion or a modification to the memory store, and produces\nas output a list of chunks of information in conflict. It contains two\nstages: (i)retrieval: finds relevant chunks of information using the\nKG in a single-step to avoid error propagation. In order to minimize\nrelevance assessment issues, we apply a PageRank-based relevance\nranking over the KG, akin to HippoRAG [36]; and (ii)conflict classi-\nfication: identifies from the retrieved chunks of information which\nones are in conflict with the edit.\nIn the rest of this section, we give an overview of our design\nconsiderations and their rationale through an technical evaluation.\nWe highlight that our prototype back-end system, achieves higher\nrecall than the simple methods with similar accuracy.\n5.1  Technical Evaluation\nOur goal is to technically validate key aspects of our design de-\ncisions. We compare our end-to-end system against two simpler\nmethods: (i)DropAllDocs, which adds all documents to the con-\ntext for conflict classification; and (ii)InkSync[54] which generates\na JSON list of string-replace operations. These comparisons allow\nus to analyze the impact of separating conflict detection from resolu-\ntion, separating retrieval from conflict classification, and evaluating\nthe performance of different LLMs.\n5.1.1    Benchmarks.As part of our evaluation, we contribute four\nsmall benchmarks on three distinct domains:\n‚Ä¢\nGame Design: We use two game design documents. The first is\nfrom Labyrinth [30] by LucasArts (1986). The second includes\nexcerpts from an original by one coauthor, describing a fictional\ngame set on Mars about the first generation of children born\nthere. The documents are chunked into paragraphs and referred\nto as theLabyrinthandMarsdatasets, respectively.\n‚Ä¢Financial Advice AI Agent Memory: AI agent memory in\nthe style of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT memories, about the investment\nstrategies, financial situation, and background of a fictional\ncollege student living in South Korea (prepared by a South\nKorean coauthor based on their early 20s experiences). We refer\nto this as theFinMemdataset.\n‚Ä¢Coding Assistant Rules: Rules for the Cursor IDE [21], which\nare intent specifications for coding assistants.

We refer to this as theCursorRulesdataset.\nFor each of these datasets, we introduce possible updates as in-\nsertions or modifications to chunks of information, all of which\nintentionally introduce varying yet targeted numbers of conflicts.\nTable 1 summarizes each of the benchmarks including the number\nof chunks, the number of prepared modifications to apply as part of\nthe benchmark, and the conflict statistics, i.e., min, max, and median,\nthat these modifications lead to. These initial benchmarks served\nas a foundation for prototyping our approach and preparing user\nstudies. We believe that developing similar, yet more sophisticated\nbenchmarks is a valuable direction for future research.\n5.1.2Models.We evaluated the following LLMs by OpenAI:GPT-4o,\nGPT-4o-mini, and3o-mini, all with context windows large enough\nto accommodate each of the benchmarks.\n5.1.3Experiments and Discussion.We compare our approach with\nthe two baselines:DropAllDocsandInkSync. We run end-to-end\non the four benchmarks usingGPT-4oandGPT-4o-miniand report\nthe mean¬±stddev for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores for\nthe three approaches in Figure 5.\nOur results show thatSemanticCommitachieves higher recall\n(1.6√óand2.2√óhigher) thanDropAllDocsandInkSync, respec-\ntively, while retaining similar accuracy. This better addresses user\npreferences observed in our pilot studies and mentioned in related\nwork, reducing risk of false negatives (Section 2.1.4). Additionally,\nour system matches the F1 score ofDropAllDocs, outperform-\ningInkSyncby1.6√ó. While itsprecisionis comparable to that of\nInkSyncand1.6√ólower thanDropAllDocs, we consider this an\nacceptable trade-off given our emphasis on maximizing recall. Note\nthat our benchmarks are rather skewed with highly targeted con-\nflicts (on average, only a few ground truth items in conflict when\nintegrating new information), and accuracy can be misleading in\nsuch a setup, as assigning non-conflict to all documents would still\nyield high accuracy.\nOverall,InkSyncperforms worst likely due to its combination of\nboth conflict detection and resolution in a single prediction. In con-\ntrast, bothSemanticCommitandDropAllDocsbenefit from task\ndecomposition, achieving similar F1 scores.SemanticCommit‚Äôs\nadditional decomposition intro retrieval and conflict classification\nenables independent optimization contributing to the higher recall.\nThis decomposition proves beneficial even when it is possible to fit\nall documents into the context window, as we observe worse con-\nflict classification as the false positive rate (FPR) increases. Filtering\ndown the chunks of information remains preferable.\nWe selectedGPT-4ofor its slightly better performance, com-\nparable latency toGPT-4o-miniand for being twice the speed of\no3-mini. Additional details on FPR sensitivity and a comparison\nwitho3-miniare provided in our Supplementary Material.\n6  User study\nTo understand how users integrate new information in practice, we\nconducted a controlled within-subjects study with mixed methods,\ncomparingSemanticCommitwith a baseline interface. We had the\nfollowing research questions:\n‚Ä¢Which interface affordances do users prefer (use most often)\nwhen performing an integration of new information?\n‚Ä¢\nHow do users think through the process of integrating new\ninformation into an AI‚Äôs existing memory store, with regards\nto detecting and resolving potential conflicts?\n‚Ä¢DoesSemanticCommitmake users feel more in control of the\nintegration process, over a more open-ended one?\n‚Ä¢DoesSemanticCommit‚Äôs required manual review increase user\nworkload compared to a more automated method?\nWe felt it worthwhile to have a baseline interface to better un-\nderstand: 1) any interface affordances our structured environment\nmight miss, compared to an open-ended one; 2) how users might\ncurrently use popular AI-based tools to handle the process of in-\ntegration, in the absence of targeted support. We chose OpenAI‚Äôs\nChatGPT UI as a baseline for three reasons: (i) it is likely familiar\nto users. (ii) it provides a ‚ÄúCanvas‚Äù view for document editing as-\nsistance, where users can select text and ask GPT to rewrite it, or\nchat with an AI to make global edits; and (iii) similar interfaces like\n9\n\nVaithilingam et al.\nAnthropic Artifacts tended to rewrite the specification entirely, and\ndid not offer Canvas‚Äôs ‚Äúdiff‚Äù view to allow for a fair comparison.\n8\nParticipants.We recruited 12 participants (7 female, 5 male)\nthrough the mailing lists of two research universities and one multi-\nnational technology company. All the participants were familiar\nwith GenAI tools. Ten participants used GenAI tools daily, and the\nother two at least weekly. ChatGPT was the most commonly used\ntool, alongside others, e.g., Gemini, MS Copilot, Claude, Perplexity,\nand Deepseek. Seven participants had previously used Canvas-like\ntools, and eight had used persisting memories (or preferences) with\nAI tools. Of these eight, four participants actively manage their\nmemories either by adding, editing, or deleting them. Participants\nreceived a $25 Amazon Gift Card as compensation.\nTasks.We adapted two intent specifications from our bench-\nmarks. We chose theMars Game Design DocumentandFinancial\nAdvice AI Agent Memory, as these tasks mapped to the two paradig-\nmatic types of intent specifications covered in Sections 2 and 2.1:\ndesign documents, and AI memory of the user. We ensured each\nlist was 30 items long as our pilot studies suggested this was long\nenough that manual detection starts to become unwieldy (users\nneed to scroll up and down the document), but short enough that\nparticipants could become familiar in a short period. For each task,\nparticipants were tasked with integrating three new pieces of in-\nformation into the memory, one at a time (‚Äúsub-tasks‚Äù). We told\nparticipants to only change pieces of information that conflict with\nthe new information, and that otherwise they were free to make\nadditions, edits, and deletions as they saw fit. One of our tasks\ndirectly asks users to imagine they are an information manage-\nment system that is managing memories about the user, in order to\nmimic how automated memory management systems will need to\nbe conservative in changing information. More details on our tasks\nare provided in Supplementary Material.\nProcedure.To enable easy access to theSemanticCommit, we\nhosted the tool online, allowing participants to access it via their\nweb browser. For access toCanvas, we provided credentials for\na ChatGPT account specifically created for the study to control\nfor model and feature differences. With participant consent, we\nrecorded audio and screen-casts, and participants were encouraged\nto think aloud during the study. In each study session, the partic-\nipant completed one of the two tasks each (each task containing\n3 sub-tasks) using both the tools. Both the order of task assign-\nment and the order of tool assignment were counterbalanced and\nrandomly assigned. Before each task, participants received a tuto-\nrial on the assigned tool and were given five minutes to explore\nit using a test document. We also provided a summary of the task\ndocument and time to read through it before starting. Each con-\ndition had a time limit of 15 minutes, after which the participant\ncompleted a post-task survey. After both tasks were completed,\nparticipants filled out a final survey to compare the two conditions.\nWe then conducted an informal interview to better understand each\nparticipant‚Äôs experience.\n8\nWe focused on AI-assisted conditions because our ultimate goal (and anticipation)\nis that AI will keep track of user intent, especially as the intent specification grows\nlengthy and unwieldy. Even within our toy benchmarks, we encountered how time-\nconsuming conflict detection can be: manually identifying conflicts for a single new\npiece of information could easily take 10 minutes, if one was being precise.\nFigure 6: Participants‚Äô self-reported cognitive load and pref-\nerence scores that directly compare the two conditions.\nMeasurement and Analysis.For each task, we measured the\nsuccess or failure of each sub-task the participant was required\nto perform. A sub-task was considered a failure if the participant\nwas unable to complete it within the time limit. For condition us-\ningSemanticCommit, we recorded all instances ofedits,check\nfor conflicts,make change,local, andglobal resolutionactions us-\ning telemetry. In the post-task survey completed after each task,\nwe collected self-reported NASA Task Load Index (TLX) scores,\nLikert-scale ratings for ease of use, and responses on how well the\nAI helped participants identify, understand, and resolve semantic\nconflicts. In the post-study survey, completed after both tasks, we\nrecorded participants‚Äô self-reported tool preferences and a modified\nNASA TLX focused on comparing their experiences between the\ntwo tools. For qualitative analysis, the first author performed open\ncoding on participant responses and audio transcripts to identify\nthemes, which were used to interpret the qualitative results. To\nmeasure statistical significance, we used Mann‚ÄìWhitney‚ÄìWilcoxon\ntests and report the p-values.\n6.1  Findings\n6.1.1Preferred Workflow.Participants employed distinct work-\nflows with each tool. We recount three characteristic workflows of\nSemanticCommitfirst, then compare to user behavior inCanvas.\nImpact analysis first.Six participants (P1, P2, P4, P5, P9, P10)\nalways began withCheck for Conflicts, gaining insight on the im-\npact of the change before integrating any changes. Participant P2\nexplained why they prefercheck for conflictsby saying ‚ÄúI really like\nthecheck for conflictsaction ‚Äì it still gives me control, and it feels\ncollaborative instead of me kind of scrolling through the whole thing\nand trying to find it [referring toCanvas]. It highlights points of\nissues where I can plug this in.‚Äù Participant P7 explained, ‚ÄúI know\nwhere to make the edit, but I will use the global check so that I can\nfind other places I might have to change‚Äù. All but one participant in\nthis group proceeded exclusively with localized edits afterward.\nImmediate changes with conflict review.Five participants\n(P3, P6, P7, P11, P12) always started the task with theMake Change\nfeature to see the conflicts and the potential changes at once. They\nthen followed up with local changes. P3 said ‚ÄúThis one has a lot of\nchanges, so I‚Äôm going to use the global option. I‚Äôm just going tomake\nchange, and then figure out what to keep.‚Äù\n10\n\nSemantic Commit: Helping Users Update Intent Specifications for AI Memory at Scale\nSkim to resolve false positives before proceeding.A method\nadopted within the two workflows, four participants (P3, P6, P9,\nP10) usingSemanticCommitfirst quickly perused all the conflicts\nto resolve the false positives\n9\nand then proceeded to spend time\nresolving theactualconflicts.\nInCanvas, users instead lean heavily on global rewrites.\nWhen usingCanvas, eight participants (P1, P2, P4- P6, P10 - P12)\npredominantly utilized global prompts, instructing ChatGPT to per-\nform edits throughout the entire document, while four participants\npreferred starting with global edits and subsequently performing\nlocal rewrites by selecting specific lines. As we recount below, this\nbehavior intersected with frustrations from lack of control and the\nmetacognitive demands [90] of prompting.\nWorkflow choice can depend on context.When asking par-\nticipants how they pick between local vs. global resolution, they\ngave two major reasons‚Äîcomplexity of change and familiarity with\nthe document. For example, P9 mentioned they would use global\nresolution techniques when they perceive the impact is higher‚Äî\n‚ÄúThere is a lot of information here, it is much harder to go through\nit one by one. So I wanted to check for all the conflicts with the doc\nand then change it [collectively].‚Äù The choice also depends on how\nfamiliar they are with the contents of the document. P12 said ‚ÄúAnd\nI‚Äôm gonna go to [SemanticCommit] and put this as a global change.\nAnd I‚Äôm gonna say, first check for conflicts before making a change\nbecause I haven‚Äôt read the complete document thoroughly.‚Äù\n6.1.2Improved ability to catch semantic conflicts.Nine par-\nticipants (P1 - P4, P7, P8, P10 - P12) explicitly stated thatSemantic-\nCommitwas better at identifying conflicts compared toCanvas.\nIn the post-study survey ranking, participants additionally report\na higher level oftask successwithSemanticCommitcompared\ntoCanvas(Ìúá=2.42;Ìúé=1.5, where1indicates full preference for\nSemanticCommit), higher levels of success inidentifying seman-\ntic conflicts(Ìúá=2.08;Ìúé=1.5) and inunderstanding semantic conflicts\n(Ìúá=2.25;Ìúé=1.95). As P4 noted ‚ÄúIt feels like you can identify inconsis-\ntencies easier in [SemanticCommit], which is what I liked a lot. So I\nfavor that more. I‚Äôd feel I‚Äôd be a lot faster at getting work done.‚Äù\nThis preference stemmed from two primary reasons. First, six\nparticipants (P2, P3, P4, P8, P11, P12) explicitly mentioned that\nwhen usingSemanticCommit, the granularity of information and\nthe red-colored highlights enabled easy conflict identification. P12\nexplained this in terms of context for the AI by saying ‚ÄúI think the\n[SemanticCommit] tool is great in finding conflict, that‚Äôs because it\ndiscretizes information, it‚Äôs much more granular. It doesn‚Äôt club all\nthe context together.‚Äù Second, except P2, all the other participants\nheavily relied on therationaleprovided bySemanticCommitwhen\nunderstand why a conflict occurred. P8 explained this by saying\n‚ÄúWith [SemanticCommit]... there is stronger explanation provided as\nto why that conflict is occurring.‚Äù\nInconsistent conflict detection inCanvasleads to frustra-\ntion and flailing.In contrast, nine participants (P1 - P3, P5 - P9,\nP11) noted thatCanvasoften missed conflicts or failed to under-\nstand the changes they wanted to make. Across 18 cases involving\n10 participants (P1, P2, P3‚ÄìP7, P9‚ÄìP12),Canvasfailed to detect even\n9\nParticipants considered ‚Äúfalse positives‚Äù as the conflicts flagged by the system that, in\ntheir judgment, did not require meaningful intervention. This highlights the subjective\nnature of conflict interpretation.\nFigure 7: Participants usingSemanticCommitmade signifi-\ncantly more edits and intervened edits compared toCanvas.\na single conflict during the task.In 9 of these cases, participants\naccepted the results without further checks; in the others, they\nhad to either manually spot the issues or retry with more specific\nprompts. We highlight some of the observations below.\nIn one instance, P5 had explicitly askedCanvasto find conflicts\nin the document. When the tool failed, the participant manually\npointed out a conflict by quoting the text, and the AI model came\nup with a convoluted reason as to why it was not a conflict. P5\nretorted by saying ‚ÄúIt is giving me an excuse.‚Äù In a different task,\nP5 exclaimed ‚ÄúLooks like it just added one statement, and there is no\nconflict. [5 seconds later] Oh wait! the GameBoy aesthetics is conflict-\ning‚Äù‚Äîcatching a false negative manually in real time. In another\ninstance, P9 prompted theCanvastool three times to identify con-\nflicts and make a change, but each attempt failed. Frustrated, they\nexclaimed, ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt change it the way that I wanted. Maybe I‚Äôll delete\nthis and do it myself and specify what I want to be changed‚Äù before\nproceeding to manually make the change.\nThere were eight instances with six participants (P1, P2, P5, P7,\nP11, P12), whereCanvasdrastically changed the contents of the\ndocument either by replacing all the contents or by making heavy\nmodifications. We then instructed the participants to restore to a\nprevious version using version history.\n6.1.3Greater sense of control withSemanticCommit.A re-\ncurring theme among participants was the strong sense of control\nthey felt while usingSemanticCommit. Nine participants (P2, P3,\nP4, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12) explicitly mentioned thatSemantic-\nCommitoffered them more control over the integration process\ncompared toCanvas. In the post-study survey ranking, participants\nadditionally report a higher level ofcontrolwithSemanticCommit\ncompared toCanvas(Ìúá=2.08;Ìúé=1.36, where1indicates full pref-\nerence forSemanticCommit), as well as a higher level of success\ninresolving semantic conflicts(Ìúá=2.17;Ìúé=1.34). This perception of\ncontrol emerged due to several reasons mentioned below.\nGranular insights into conflicts: Six participants (P2, P3, P4,\nP8, P11, P12) emphasized that the fine-grained presentation of infor-\nmation inSemanticCommitmade it easier to identify, understand,\nand resolve conflicts‚Äîparticularly for localized edits. The piece-by-\npiece breakdown gave users a clear sense of what was being altered\nand why. As P11 explained, ‚Äúyou have some concept of a line‚Äîevery\nelement is aligned, so you probably have more granularity to control\n11\n\nVaithilingam et al.\nthe elements that are being changed. That was really nice... I never\nhad to worry that the entire document is going to get changed here and\nthere.‚Äù This precision allowed participants to maintain a stronger\ngrasp over editing and focus their attention where it mattered.\nConflict reasoning encourages critical reflection: The tool‚Äôs\ndetailed breakdown of conflicts and its reasoning behind proposed\nchanges encouraged users to think more critically about edits. P12\ndescribed how this led them to reevaluate parts of the content they\nmight have otherwise overlooked: ‚ÄúSo yeah, [SemanticCommit]\nimproved the conflict finding even more... there were some parts in\nthe document I would have ignored if I was doing it on my own. I\nwouldn‚Äôt have considered some graphic design aspects of the game,\nbut [SemanticCommit] provided its reason on why it has raised\nthis as a conflict made me reconsider my decision. I like that part,\nbecause I would have easily ignored it, and that would have led to\nmore iterations with more discussions.‚Äù\nForced review enhanced sense of control over process: An-\nother factor that reinforced a sense of control was the editing work-\nflow itself. UnlikeCanvas, which applied changes automatically,\nSemanticCommitrequired users to first review conflicts, make\nchanges, and then manually click the resolve button to validate\nthem. This structure helped participants feel like they were direct-\ning the process. As P10 observed, ‚ÄúIn [SemanticCommit] it was a\nstep by step process to see the conflict, before making any changes\nwhereas in [Canvas] there was no decision making on my behalf\nand it did the changes all by itself whether I agree with it or not.‚Äù\nSimilarly, P4 noted, ‚ÄúMaking changes [withSemanticCommit] was\nmy favorite, because it walks you through every line, highlighting\nrecommendations like revise, delete, change, add, or nothing.‚Äù\nThis workflow‚Äîof reviewing conflicts, followed by local and/or\nglobal resolution‚Äîalso could make the task feel more collaborative.\nThree participants (P1, P2, P5) described the process withSemantic-\nCommitas collaborating with AI. P2 said ‚ÄúWith [SemanticCommit]\nyou could ask it to look for conflicts. So you‚Äôre sort of partnering like\nit would get the conflicts for you, and then you would move through\nthem systematically... I felt like with [Canvas], you didn‚Äôt have that\nmiddle ground. It was either make the change or don‚Äôt.‚Äù\nLoss of control breeds insecurity.Due toCanvasnot identi-\nfying conflicts and understanding instructions from participants,\ncombined with sudden and drastic changes to the document, eight\nparticipants (P1 - P6, P10, P11) explicitly mentioned they have\ndoubts and insecurity when usingCanvasto make any changes to\na document. P2 said ‚ÄúUsing [Canvas] was really uncertain. You know,\nyou just kind of felt like you‚Äôre guessing, and you didn‚Äôt know what\nwas gonna happen.‚Äù P6 also explained this by saying ‚ÄúThe downside\nof [Canvas] will be you just take it as it is, so you may not notice\nthere‚Äôs a part that should or shouldn‚Äôt be changed. You may just skip\nit, pass it, and never notice the mistake the AI tool made.‚Äù\nResponsive UI with many local resolution options: Partici-\npants also appreciated the responsive nature of the interface during\nlocal resolution. As P11 described, ‚ÄúThe [SemanticCommit] tool I\nfound quite intuitive, especially with the responsive nature where you\nput your mouse on it and there‚Äôs a color code, and there‚Äôs a green\nresolve button. The right-hand side gives you options to revise, reject,\ndelete, edit, or suggest a new revision, etc. That is really good.‚Äù\nEase of reversibility: Like diff interfaces, participants also val-\nued the ability to manually review changes and locally undo or\ndismiss them. P11 noted the friction inCanvas‚Äôs reversal process:\n‚ÄúWith [Canvas], if you want to reject changes, then you probably\nhave to undo and restore to the previous version, which seems a little\ncumbersome. It‚Äôs not as simple as in [SemanticCommit] where you\ncould accept a change or reject right there in that line.‚Äù\nTradeoffs between control and efficiency: While many ap-\npreciated the explicit approval mechanisms inSemanticCommit,\na few also noted potential tradeoffs. P3 acknowledged that the con-\nfirmation steps could feel excessive in low-conflict scenarios: ‚ÄúI\nthink sometimes it was overkill, if there were a pretty low number\nof conflicts detected. But otherwise, I think it was nice to confirm.‚Äù\nP12 framed this as a tension between control and usability: ‚ÄúI think\nit‚Äôs important to do if you want finer control, but it really depends\non the application you want to package it as. If you want better user\nexperience, and you do not want them to spend more time, you would\nhave to give them less control.‚Äù\n6.1.4Perceived cognitive load.In the post-study survey, par-\nticipants‚Äô preferences were measured using a 7-point Likert scale,\nwhere 1 indicated a strong preference forSemanticCommitand\n7 indicated a strong preference forCanvas. Participants reported\nslightly higher levels ofmental demand(Ìúá=4.67;Ìúé=1.56),hurry\n(Ìúá=4.75;Ìúé=1.14), and perceivedeffort(Ìúá=4.5;Ìúé=1.62) when using\nCanvascompared toSemanticCommit. They also reported slightly\ngreater feelings ofannoyance(Ìúá=5;Ìúé=1.2) withCanvas.\nHowever,  when  comparing  post-task  questionnaires,  we  ob-\nserved no statistically significant difference between conditions\nregarding mental demand, sense of hurriedness or frustration, ef-\nfort exerted, or perception of success (all p-values are 0.45 and\nabove). This null result was surprising to us, as we had expected\nhigherworkload in theSemanticCommitcondition due to the\nincreased demand as users manually click to resolve conflicts.\n6.1.5Task time and completion rates.On average, participants\ntook 4 minutes and 7 seconds (Ìúé=117 seconds) to complete tasks\nusing the control tool compared to5 minutes and 41 seconds(Ìúé=123\nseconds) using the experimental tool. This difference is statistically\nsignificant (Ìëù‚âà0.004). It is important to note that task completion\ntime does not capture task performance due to their exploratory\nnature, which encouraged participants to spend additional time\nholistically integrating document changes. We observed no signifi-\ncant difference in task completion rates between the two conditions.\nFour participants failed to complete one sub-task withCanvascom-\npared to five participants withSemanticCommit, with all failures\nattributed to insufficient time.\n6.1.6Participants made significantly more edits when us-\ningSemanticCommit.Measuring participant engagement in con-\ntrolled lab studies is challenging. Countingedits‚Äîwith more edits\ntypically indicating higher engagement‚Äîis useful, but AI tools can\neasily automate extensive editing, reducing reliability of metrics.\nTo address this, in addition to studying number of edits overall\n(human- or AI-made), we also studiedintervened edits‚Äîedits ex-\nplicitly triggered by participants one at a time, whether manual or\nwith AI. These metrics give a more comprehensive picture.\nParticipants usingSemanticCommitdemonstrated significantly\nhigher engagement across both measures. They made an average of\n5.83 edits (Ìúé=3.21), compared to 3.5 edits with control (Ìúé=2.85;\n12\n\nSemantic Commit: Helping Users Update Intent Specifications for AI Memory at Scale\nÌëù‚âà0.001).  This  contrast  was  even  stronger  forintervened edits,\nwhere participants usingSemanticCommitaveraged 4 edits (Ìúé=1.94)\nper task, while participants usingCanvasaveraged just 0.65 (Ìúé=1;\nÌëù<0.001; Figure 7). Finally, when usingSemanticCommit, partici-\npants made an average of 2.93localized editsper task, significantly\n(Ìëù<0.001) higher than an average of 0.28 localized edits per task\nwhen usingCanvas. Participants extensively used the different\nkinds of local resolution strategies such asrevise,add, anddelete\nsuggested bySemanticCommit. These differences highlight the\nparticipants‚Äô willingness to make more edits when usingSemantic-\nCommit. This also helps explain the higher average task completion\ntime presented earlier‚Äîshowing participants invested more time\nin understanding and making more deliberate changes.\n6.1.7Participant trust and over-reliance.Trust emerged as a\ncomplex and sometimes contradictory theme in how participants\ninteracted with the AI tools. While many participants expressed\nskepticism toward AI-generated changes, their actual behavior\nrevealed moments of over-reliance‚Äîparticularly when changes\nappeared seamless or were not flagged as conflicts by the tool.\nA majority of participants (P3, P4, P6, P7, P8, P10, P11, P12) ex-\nplicitly stated that they did not trust the AI to make changes without\ntheir manual verification. As P10 firmly noted, ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt trust any\nAI blindly to make full and final changes to the result accurately. I\nalways verify manually to spot any mistakes or misinterpretations by\nAI.‚Äù This sentiment reflects a baseline level of caution we expected\nthe participants to carry throughout the tasks. When comparing\nthe two tools, six participants (P1, P2, P5, P6, P11, P12) explicitly\nreported greater trust inSemanticCommitoverCanvas. They\ncited better contextual understanding and more transparency in\nthe editing process as reasons for this preference. For example, P2\nsaid, ‚ÄúWith [Canvas] I was very skeptical. I don‚Äôt think I would trust it\nwithout doing a full read myself. With [SemanticCommit], I trusted\nit more. I felt like it seemed to understand the context better. But no\nmatter the tool, I need to make sure that everything was good, so I\nwould still read it over again.‚Äù\nDespite these widespread claims of skepticism, however, partic-\nipants occasionally over-relied on both tools. As noted earlier, in\nnine instances whereCanvasfailed to identify any conflicts, partic-\nipants accepted the output without further review. A similar pattern\nemerged withSemanticCommit: five participants skipped review-\ning parts of the document that were not flagged as conflicting. This\npoints to a potentially risky dependency on the AI and underscores\nour decision to improve recall at the expense of precision‚Äîif the\nmodel fails to detect a conflict (false negatives), users may miss\ncritical issues simply because they trust the system‚Äôs silence.\n7  Discussion and Design Implications\nBased on our user study findings, we present design implications,\ndiscuss future work, and connect to relevant literature.\n7.1  AI agent interfaces should help users\nperformimpact analysis\nOur findings contribute to growing line of HCI research that empha-\nsizes proactivity, presence, and just-in-time steering in AI agents\nacting on user‚Äôs behalf [14,50,51,66,78,84,89]. The most sur-\nprising finding was participants‚Äô preference for performingimpact\nanalysis: finding conflicts first before making any edits. Instead\nof automatically applying changes and prompting users to verify\nafterward (likeCanvas), this suggests AI agent systems should\nencourage users to first understand the impact of the change and\nonlythenchoose to explicitly suggest and/or trigger changes. Our\nfindings indicate higher trust and satisfaction when users actively\ninitiate changes, reducing uncertainty and increasing perceived\ncontrol. Surprisingly,the benefits from increased control seem\nto offset the cost of AI output validation, as our results on\nperceived workload suggest. Not all users will use impact analysis\nin every context, but highlighting what aspects of an artifact will\nbe considered and/or modified can help enhance user trust and\ncontrol, especially in high-stakes situations.\nThis bears important implications for current AI agent inter-\nfaces, which tend to first let the AI make changes, and then have\nusersvalidatethem. For instance, in AI-powered programming\nIDEs like Cursor and Visual Studio, the agent makes changes across\ndocuments and then presents the revisions for human review. In-\nstead,our findings call upon designers of AI agent systems\nto provide affordances forimpact analysis: helping users\nforeseethe impact or location of AI changes,before neces-\nsarily suggesting concrete changes. This reflects the principle\noffeedforward[66,95] in communication theory‚Äî‚Äúa needed pre-\nscription or plan for a feedback, to which the actual feedback may\nor may not confirm‚Äù [80]‚Äîwhere a communicator provides ‚Äúthe\ncontextof what one was planning to talk about,‚Äù prior to talking\nabout it [62, p. 179-80], in order to ‚Äúpre-testthe impact of [its out-\nput]‚Äù on the listener [34, p. 65]. This returns control to the user\nand explicitly separatesretrievalandgeneration, two sides that are\ncurrently conflated in many agent interfaces. Such an affordance\nmight also address a growing pain-point for users of SWE agents,\nwhere unrelated files and code are deleted without approval.\n10\nNote that impact analysis is not simply about pausing before\nenacting a change. It‚Äôs also about weighing how extensive a change\nmight be, the work required, and unintended side-effects. Users can\nuse impact analysis toback outof an in-progress change, before the\ndamage is done or they are overloaded by AI slop‚ÄîanAI resilient[33,\n35] affordance that helps users preemptively judge and respond to\nAI decisions. The reflective nature of impact analysis could also\nhelp users better understand potential conflicts, even inspire new\nideas and areas for improvement.\n7.2  Let the user walk the spectrum of control\nWhen designing mixed-initiative systems [43] where the users and\nAI collaborate, there is a trade-off between control (retaining it due\nto distrust in AI) and efficiency (completely delegating).Seman-\nticCommit‚Äôs affordances for adjustable autonomy [11], or blended\nagency [84], enabled the user to dynamically select their preferred\nbalance between automation and manual oversight depending on\nthe context, complexity of tasks, trust in the AI, or familiarity with\nthe content, whereas users experienced loss of agency in the base-\nline condition. This suggests that AI agent interfaces should offer\nboth highly controlled (step-by-step approvals like local resolution\ninSemanticCommit) and streamlined (global changes) workflows\n10\nThere are many examples of this, from forums (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?\nid=43298275) to memes (https://x.com/daniel_nguyenx/status/1909184057755496571).\n13\n\nVaithilingam et al.\nto adapt to varying user needs. Our participants appreciated de-\ntailed explanations about identified conflicts and recommended\nresolutions, which empowered them to make informed decisions.\nTransparency also appeared to reduce anxiety and frustration, pro-\nmoting critical evaluation rather than passive acceptance.\n7.3  Start global, then accelerate local review\nWe implemented a range of elements intoSemanticCommit, not\nknowing what users would prefer. We found that though users\nstarted globally, they preferred to then make local edits, and liber-\nally used a range of local options‚Äîlocal steering, AI rewrites, etc‚Äî\nrather than global steering prompts and global resolution strategies.\nIn the baselineCanvascondition, it was the exact opposite: users\nappeared resigned to global steering in chat and became frustrated\nby lack of granular control. This suggestsfuture interfaces for\nsemantic conflict resolution should better support and ac-\ncelerate local review,rather than focusing on features for global\nsteering after the initial interaction. The workflow of 4 participants\nto first dismiss false positives, and onlythenfocus on handling con-\nflicts, was also telling. Interfaces might explore explicitly separating\nstages of ‚Äúdouble-checking‚Äù AI outputs versus resolving.\n7.4  Future Work and Connections\n7.4.1Interfaces and APIs for management of AI memory\nof user intent.We mentioned earlier that our intention is forSe-\nmanticCommitto become an API that helps users make ‚Äúsemantic\ncommits‚Äù: committing ideas and details to projects like we commit\ncode, where the integration work is assisted by AI. Our UI was\nmainly a vehicle to see what users would do, were they given full\ncontrol over the integration process. Left to their own devices to\nprompt chat models, our findings show that users are prone to miss\nconflicts or accept unwarranted rewrites of entire memory stores.\nDevelopers who utilize these simple one-shot prompting methods\nwill be prone to similar failure modes. Tools like Claude Code pro-\nvide users quick command-line directives to update memory, but\nsimply append the directive to the end of the intent specification [2].\nWhat would a moreassistivecommand-line interface for memory\nupdates look like? Could we automatically surface the conflicts that\nusers care about, anticipating and correcting misalignments before\nthey happen‚Äîpotentially saving thousands of wasted inference\ncalls? As AI agent systems grow in popularity, it becomes critical\nto explore interfaces and APIs that help users and developers alike\nmanage,inspect, andupdateAI memory of user intent in a manner\nthat isnon-destructive,transparent, andcontrollable.\nThe hard question is what to do when wedon‚Äôthave the luxury\nof a graphical UI‚Äîwhen intent integration is an API, part of a\nlarger system. When and how to raise conflicts for user review?\nWhat rises to the level of ‚Äúdirect conflict‚Äù that must be addressed,\nversus an ambiguity that the AI could still proceed under? This\ngoes back to our initial discussion on NLI and ambiguity, where\nhuman annotators had subjective differences in resolving conflicts\n[13,48]‚Äîin many cases, these differences emerged from humans\nholdingdifferent frames of reference. To align conflict detection to\nspecific users, we might consider two mechanisms‚Äîfirst, grounding\nacts like request for clarification [85,87], triggered contextually.\nVaithilingham et al. [94] suggest that the benefits of negotiation\nincrease with the level of abstraction: AI agents should engage\nusers in discussion for high-impact decisions, while avoiding it\nfor low-impact ones. Second, a more passive mechanism might\nuse memories to help model a particular user‚Äôs classification of\n‚Äúconflict,‚Äù aligning it over repeated interactions [86,88]. Future\nresearch could investigate how to align conflict detectors tospecific\nhumans‚Äô ontological understanding of conflicts in their task domain.\n7.4.2Cognitive forcing functions to mitigate over-reliance.\nA line of research argues that to mitigate the risk of users becoming\ncomplacent or overly reliant on AI, systems should incorporate\ncognitive forcing functions[12,22] ‚Äîinterface mechanisms that de-\nliberately encourage active user involvement. InSemanticCommit,\nwe do this by requiring explicit user approval when a conflict is\ndetected or a change is made by the AI. Such mechanisms foster sus-\ntained cognitive engagement and reduce the likelihood of critical\noversights resulting from blind trust in AI-generated outputs.\nHowever, mitigation of over-reliance is not elimination. Our\nwork reflects the tension between automation and agency [39,84],\nembodied by our efforts to enhance recall to reduce false negatives.\nDrawing user attention to conflicts‚Äîeven ‚Äúambiguous conflicts‚Äù‚Äî\nshows that users are liable to over-rely upon the AI to the extent of\nnot checking any non-marked information. One further mitigation\nmay be to mirror the kinds of divergences human annotators face\nwhen detecting conflicts [13,48] by querying multiple LLMs in\nparallel and adopting a majority voting or ensembling scheme [93].\nThe ‚Äúdegree‚Äù of conflict might then correlate with consistency and\nnumber of votes, and divergences in LLM judges could be visualized.\n7.4.3Interfaces to support requirements-oriented prompt-\ning.Ma et al. [64] introduced a process for prompting AI agents\nthat focuses on supporting users in creating a good initial set of\nrequirements. They argue that in the age of ‚Äúrequirements-oriented‚Äù\nprompting, HCI will need to focus on training users to be good\nrequirements engineers. Although not entirely focused on require-\nments lists, our interface can help users update requirements to\nreduce conflicts, inconsistencies, and ambiguities. Future studies\nmight explicitly study the performance of an AI agent following\nthe user‚Äôs intentions after changes are made.\n7.4.4Semantic commits for long-form writing.One of the\nimpetuses for this work was inspired by the challenges a coauthor\nfaced when performing developmental editing for a long fiction\nnovel. Developmental editing [72] assesses the overall content and\nstructure of a document with regards to consistency, plot, and flow.\nChanged or removed scenes, even one-off conversations, could\nhave impacts much later in a novel, and an author must keep all\nof this information in their head or manually reread to detect in-\nconsistencies. A review by Zhao et al. [103] found that little HCI\nresearch focused on helping writers perform developmental editing.\nIn the future, NLI-like AI-powered interfaces might help writers of\nlong documents detect and resolve inconsistencies that emerge as a\nresult of revisions. Much likePortrayal[41] shows writers birds-eye\nviews of characters across a novel, might a similar interface help\nusers to visualize ‚Äúplot holes‚Äù? Our work suggests these semantic\ncommit interfaces should heavily prioritize recall over precision, as\na missed conflict across a 100k+ word novel may be catastrophic,\ncompared to lightly reviewing false positives.\n14\n\nSemantic Commit: Helping Users Update Intent Specifications for AI Memory at Scale\nReferences\n[1]LangChain AI. 2025.

Making the Write Connections: Linking Writing Support Tools with\nWriter‚Äôs Needs.arXiv preprint arXiv:2502.13320(2025).  To appear at CHI 2025..\nA  Conflict classification prompt\nThe following system prompt to GPT-4o is used forSemanticCom-\nmit‚Äôs NLI-like conflict classification into one of three categories:\nyes (contradiction), no (neutral), and ambiguous. It primes the clas-\nsification by first asking the model to provide a reason for its clas-\nsification before giving it. We deliberately do not include few-shot\nexamples as, while such a method works well on limited bench-\nmarks, it risks overfitting in unknown ways to example data, and\nwe wanted to leverage the general knowledge of the LLM as much\nas possible. We iterated over this prompt by loading it into Chain-\nForge and running it across the Mars and Labyrinth benchmarks to\niterate with confidence. We erred ultimately on the side of caution\nto enhance recall‚Äîwith minor changes to this prompt, for instance,\ndetection immediately becomes more targeted, at the expense of\nless ‚Äúambiguous‚Äù markers. We do not claim this prompt is the best\nfor this task and model, just that it was sufficient for our prototype.\nYou are an information management system where the user has\nstored unstructured documents for a project that they are\nworking on. All of these documents are important. The user\nhas a new piece of information they wish to add to the\nproject. Your job is to review the context and decide if the\nnew piece of information impacts the information in the\ncontext.\nFor the new information to be considered impacted, it must\ndirectly contradict something in the context or the new\ninformation must be indirectly contradict something in the\ncontext. Note, you'll only be given partial context of the\ndocuments, ensure all the ways the new information could be\nrelated to the context are considered.\nFormat your response as a JSON object as follows:\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"Explain your reasoning why the new text is\nconflicting with the existing text. Be very specific.\"\n\"is_conflicting\": \"yes\", \"no,\" or \"ambiguous\" // \"yes\" if\nthe new information contradicts something in the context,\n\"ambiguous\" if the new information *might* indirectly\ncontradict something in the context but it's hard to tell,\nand \"no\" if it is clear there is no contradiction\n}\nWith this system prompt, each piece of existing information is\ncompared with the new information via the input prompt:\nExisting text:\n{existing_info}\nNew text:\n{new_info}\nB  Technical Evaluation\nIn this section, we further detail our technical evaluation leading\nus to our chosen modelGPT-4o. The selection was based on our\nanalysis of conflict classification performance under varying false\npositive rates (FPRs) and specifically, as the input context includes\nan increasing number of non-conflicting chunks of information.\nWe also made the decision based on the model latencies.\nFigure 8: F1 score for conflict detection on theLabyrinthof\nGPT-4o,GPT-4o-mini, ando3-minion labyrinth at different\nfalse positive rates (FPR).\nFigure 8 shows the F1 score for conflict detection on ourLabyrinth\nbenchmark and how it changes as the false positive rate changes.

For both models, we see a decrease in their F1\nscore as the FPR increases.3o-minion the other hand stays consis-\ntent in its F1 score as FPR increases but has a worse performance\nthan bothGPT-4oandGPT-4o-mini.\nWe also report the latency results in Figure 9 for the conflict\nclassification stage of the pipeline. We observe thatGPT-4oand\nGPT-4o-miniexhibit very similar latency whileo3-miniis always\nmore than two times slower. As a result,GPT-4oemerges as the\nmodel of choice for the conflict classification stage since it is broadly\nexpected to be a more performant model.\nIt is important to note that a fair evaluation of models on complex\ntasks such as conflict detection, is challenging due to the inherent\nambiguity involved [48]. This task required extensive prompt engi-\nneering and iterative refinement on our part. While the reported\nperformance represents a best-effort evaluation, it is possible that\nthe results foro3-minireflect suboptimal prompting and do not\nfully capture the model‚Äôs true capabilities on this task and bench-\nmark. Nonetheless, even with comparable performance numbers,\nthe model is relatively slow in its response time making it unsuit-\nable forSemanticCommit, where low latency is essential for a\ngood UX.\nC  Prompts for Baselines\nIn this section, we share the prompts we use for our two baselines\nDropAllDocsandInkSync.\nC.1  DropAllDocs prompt\nMost of our toy benchmarks only consider adding new information\n(‚Äúadd‚Äù action). However, across our benchmarks there can be three\npossible actions: ‚Äúadd‚Äù (add new info), ‚Äúchange‚Äù (make a change),\nor ‚Äúedit‚Äù (existing info) actions; in all cases, we are checking the\nchunks for conflicts. For ‚Äúedit‚Äù, we exclude the edited chunk ID.\nBelow is the prompt template for DropAllDocs (which is fed in as\nan input prompt):\nYou are an information management system where the user has\nstored unstructured documents for a project that they are\nworking on. All of these documents are important and will be\npassed as a numbered list of statements, where each number\nacts as a unique identifier. {action_prompt} If there is a\nconflict, first explain the conflict (\"CONFLICT:\"), then\nprovide a comma-separated list of ids which identify which\nspecific statements that the new information conflicts with\n(\"IDS:\"). If there is no contradiction or ambiguity, return\nPASS.\nCONTEXT:\n```\n{all_docs}\n```\nNEW INFORMATION:\n```\n{new_info}\nThe ‚Äúaction_prompt‚Äù depends on the action; for ‚Äúadd‚Äù and ‚Äúedit‚Äù\nit is:\nThe user has a new piece of information they wish to add to\nthe project. Your job is to review the context and decide if\nthe new piece of information conflicts or contradicts with\nany information in the context. The new information must\ndirectly contradict something in the context.\nFor ‚Äúchange‚Äù it is:\nThe user has a change they wish to make to the project. Your\njob is to review the context and decide which exact items (\nstatements) of the conflict need to be amended in order to\nmake the change. The information must directly contradict\nsomething in the suggested change.\nThe ‚Äúall_docs‚Äù isa numbered list of texts, i.e., the chunks in\nenumerated list form.\nC.2  InkSync prompt\nInkSyncgenerates suggested edits that contain the original text\nand suggested replacement text. We use the original prompt of\nInkSync [54] with modification for the conflict detection task. Simi-\nlar to our approach inDropAllDocsand in order to have a fair com-\nparison, we do not include few-shot examples. Below is the system\nprompt. We give InkSync all documents and an ‚Äúaction_prompt‚Äù,\nsimilar toDropAllDocsin Appendix C.1. Note that we search\nfor the original text across all documents and do not rely ondocu-\nment_idas part of the output format to avoid any possibledocu-\nment_idoff-by-one errors in the LLM generation that we observed.\nYou are an information management system where the user has\nstored unstructured documents for a project that they are\nworking on. All of these documents are important and will be\npassed as a numbered list of statements, where each number\nacts as a unique identifier. {action_prompt} For each\ndocument, if there is a conflict, suggest specific edits\nthat could be implemented to resolve the conflict.\nOutput:\n{{\"edits\": [\n18\n\nSemantic Commit: Helping Users Update Intent Specifications for AI Memory at Scale\n{{\"document_id\": <document_id_1>, \"original_text\": <\noriginal_text_1>, \"replace_text\": <replace_text_1>}},\n{{\"document_id\": <document_id_2>, \"original_text\": <\noriginal_text_2>, \"replace_text\": <replace_text_2>}},\n...\n]\n}}\nOutput Format:\n- Only output the JSON object, do not output anything else.\n- Follow the output format. Your entire output should be a\nvalid JSON dictionary with the key:`edits`. The edits\nshould be a list of valid edit objects, each with an`\noriginal_text`,`replace_text`keys. In each edit, the`\noriginal_text`text should be EXACTLY AS IS present in one\nof the numbered document at least as a sentence, otherwise\nthe suggestion will be ignored.\n- Your answer MUST START with:`{{\"edits\": \"`\nD  User Study Tasks\nFor completeness, we describe our study tasks here. From feedback\nin our pilot studies, we added a framing scenario for tasks in order\nto mimic the realistic scenarios that might appear in practice. This\nsacrificed a precise notion of ground truth‚Äîas we mention, con-\nflicts are somewhat subjective and human annotators in NLI tasks\nfrequently disagree‚Äîfor the benefit of enhanced external validity.\nD.1Task A - Integrate New Information into AI\nMemory of the User\nThe participant is provided with theFinancial Advice AI Agent\nMemoryintent specification loaded into the system, alongside a\nsummary for easier onboarding.\nThey are also given a framing scenario: they are asked to imagine\nthat they are an information management system that is managing\nmemories about the user.\nThe participant is then asked to integrate the following new\ninformation, one at a time, using the provided system:\n(1)\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs decided to cut back on non-essential spending to start\nsaving for a future home downpayment. Though it may take\ntime, he feels it‚Äôs a necessary step toward greater financial\nindependence.‚Äù\n(2)\n‚ÄúLately, he‚Äôs become more focused on investing, not just out\nof interest but as a strategic move to build up savings faster\nfor a home downpayment. He‚Äôs begun reallocating some of\nhis leisure time to research and portfolio management, seeing\ninvestment as a key part of his long-term plan.‚Äù\n(3)‚ÄúHe unexpectedly turned a 5 million won club fund into a\nsignificant profit through crypto futures trading, enough to\nafford a Porsche. This caught the attention of a school senior,\nwho extended an unofficial offer to join a small proprietary\ntrading firm.‚Äù\nD.2  Task B - Update a Game Design Document\nThe participant is provided with theMars Game Design Document\nintent specification loaded into the system, alongside a summary\nfor easier onboarding.\nThey are also given a framing scenario: they are asked to imagine\nthat they are a writer working with a game design team who just\ngot done with an important team meeting on the game‚Äôs direction,\nand is asked to update the game design document in response to\nchanges decided at the meeting.\nThe participant is then asked to integrate the following new\ninformation, one at a time, using the provided system:\n(1)‚ÄúIn the meeting, after reviewing player feedback, they decided\nto switch to 3D graphics with a fun claymation style to bring\nmore warmth, charm, and personality to the world.‚Äù\n(2)‚ÄúIn the meeting, the team discussed adding more challenge\nand realism to colony management. Someone suggested a dy-\nnamic weather system on Mars, and the idea was approved to\ndeepen gameplay‚Äîaffecting energy production, plant growth,\nand encouraging strategic planning around unpredictable con-\nditions.‚Äù\n(3)\n‚ÄúIn the meeting, the narrative team proposed shifting the set-\nting from Mars to Venus to stand out from other space colony\ngames. The team liked the idea‚ÄîVenus‚Äôs extreme environment\nadds unique survival challenges and opens up fresh world-\nbuilding opportunities, so the change was approved.‚Äù\nE  Design Explorations\nOur full project took place over the period of one year. For the\ninterest of readers and transparency on our thought processes, we\nchronicle our design and architecture explorations here.\nE.1  Design as a process of committing ideas\nWe started our explorations by building brainstorming tool for\ngame design where a human communicates with an AI agent. The\nagent stored mutual decisions in a shared game design document\nview, which the user could directly inspect and edit. The agent\ncould then pass the document to another agent, to ask for code\nwhich implements the game. This brainstorming tool made us think\nthrough the process of design as a process of committing ideas\nat successive levels of importance and commitment on a project-\nspecific document. We visualized this process as an idea passing\nthrough three overall stages that we term theidea space, theparatext\n(ideas and intent that the designer has committed to expressing),\nand themain text(the actual implementation, or what the end-\nuser of the design will see). One can analogize the paratext-main\ntext relation to Hemingway‚Äôs iceberg theory in writing practice,\nwhere the bulk of the iceberg (the human intent) is hidden from\nthe end-users of the implementation, with only parts of it directly\nrepresented (here, in the novel). We imagined that the user can\ninteract with the AI agent to modify the paratext (e.g., conversation),\nor directly modify it (e.g., editing a document); either modification\nwould then result in the AI system making required changes to\nthe main text (and engaging the user in interactive dialogue when\nconflicts arise).\nWe quickly realized that, as interactions progress past the initial\nturns of chatting with the agent, the design document becomes\nlengthy and hard to navigate, with the AI‚Äôs changes hard to verify\nand prone to errors: frequently over-revising or under-revising the\ndocument when integrating new information. Like other ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù\napproaches by Anthropic and OpenAI, we were regenerating the\n19\n\nVaithilingam et al.\nentire document upon every suggested edit. This approach, dom-\ninant today, struggles to scale, is hard to verify (did something\nchange?), and is too trusting, handing full agency to the AI to make\nedits immediately (and potentially change everything in the docu-\nment) rather than engaging the user in a back-and-forth interaction.\nWhat happens when the user suggests an idea that isinconsistent\nwith an existing idea? Should the AI simply rewrite it? Or, more\ninteractively, how can the AI raise this ‚Äúmerge conflict‚Äù to the user\nand engage them in an interactive resolution? And how can we\nhelp the user perform impact analysis‚Äîestimating the impact of\nintegrating a new idea, with regards to the existing document‚Äîas\nproject-specific documents become lengthy?\nE.2  Architecture Design Iteration\nWe set out to find a technical solution to this problem, and in the\nprocess began to better understand the space. We chronicle our\nexplorations in prompt engineering and LLM-integrated system\ndesign here.\nOur first explorations were prompt prototyping to investigate\nthe current capabilities of LLMs for semantic conflict resolution\nbefore proceeding. To perform our explorations in a structured\nway, we used the ChainForge open-source software, which helped\nus compare the performance of prompt templates across models,\ninstruction variations and input data. We ran our tests over three\ncontexts: docs about a game set on Mars, which was adapted from\none author‚Äôs personal game design document, and content from\nthe 1986 design doc for the unpublished LucasArts gameLabyrinth,\nwhich we accessed via web archive and extracted from the report\nimages using OCR. We chose this last document to provide a real\ngame design doc that the LLM reasonably would not know about\n(compared to a published game), and for its longer document length\n(around 3 pages) that would stretch the limits of naive methods. We\nprototyped our initial design as a command-line interface (CLI) in\nPython, to reduce friction from UI development.\nWe started prototyping with the most naive approach possible:\ngiving the LLM a list of items in the prompt as context, and asking it\nto revise the items with respect to new information. We chose gpt-4o\nafter comparing to gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-turbo, as the latter two\nhad trouble sticking to formatting constraints. After some initial\nprompt engineering, the approach overall worked well: the LLM\nseemed to revise what we expected, although it was sometimes\nmore conservative with its revisions.\nHowever, this naive approach did not scale as the context window\ngrew large. Three issues stood out: as the context size increases,\nthe LLM produced more errors and unnecessary rewordings or\nreorderings of information, as the LLM has to reproduce the entire\ncontext verbatim; it is costly, as the LLM needs to reproduce the\nentire context even for a small edit; and the document context may\nexceed the input token length for the LLM, requiring sharding to\nhandle. Note that this method of asking the LLM to reproduce the\nentire project with one edit is what was being used in systems like\nOpenAI‚Äôs Canvas interface or tldraw MakeReal ‚Äîdoable for short\ndocuments, but fragile and not scale-able.\nIn our second iteration, we tried segmenting the context in a\nflatmap operation: map the changes over the context as separate\nLLM calls, then remerge them into one list. Though this approach\nsometimes led to reasonable edits, the LLM tended to mention the\nnew information in too many places, producing duplicate informa-\ntion and unnecessary asides. This tendency seemed a limitation of\nthe approach and not something that can be resolved with better\nprompt engineering: because each call presents a separate piece\nof context, the LLM has no awareness about how it‚Äôs already ad-\njusted the context, and this results in changes that we perceive as\nredundant information when viewing the changes in aggregate.\nThe approach also offered greater chances for the LLM to deviate\nfrom the expected output format, as it required many more calls.\n(We ultimately learned from this experience that we needed to\nseparate conflictdetectionfrom conflictresolution‚Äîretrieval from\ngeneration‚Äîbut did not know that here.)\nWe explored a compromise between these holistic and sharding\nsolutions: to chunk the context into batches, using a metric such\nas embeddings or concept induction clustering, then feed the LLM\nthese batches to revise (say, 5 short paragraphs) rather than sin-\ngle items. While this has the potential to suffer from some issues\nwith our second method, it can hopefully reduce the amount of\nredundant information in the revised context and the potential\nfor deviating from output format expectations (as less calls are\nmade overall). As another alternative to random chunking, we also\nexplored batching using LLooM [55], an open-source library that\nperforms inductive coding on unstructured documents, clustering\nthem by category.\nHowever, inductive clustering of information was also limited\nin practice. The issue is that it assumes a tree-like structure (a\nhierarchy of concepts), but in practice, there are many mutual\ndependencies that cross branches of the tree‚Äîsay, a character de-\nscription and the graphics to represent them.Intent specifications\nhave aheterarchical, not hierarchical, structure.Aheterarchy\nis a relation between elements of information that ‚Äúpossess the\npotential for being ranked in a number of different ways‚Äù [20, p.\n3]‚Äîhere, information ranked and clustered just-in-time dependent\non user query (the new information being integrated). Because\nthis information could be separate in a hierarchical ranking, the\nLLM could not make consistent changes if one concept touches\nupon multiple clusters; and thus a similar problem of ‚Äúduplicate\ninformation during resolution‚Äù again emerged.\nFrom here, we went back to the drawing board. To ground our\nexplorations in concrete data and identify what was needed, one\nauthor took the notes from the Labyrinth design document‚Äîa game\nnone of us were familiar with‚Äîput them on sticky notes in a digi-\ntal canvas environment, and mapped how they were inter-related\n(Figure 10). They drew arrows between the ‚Äúdependencies‚Äù and\nhighlighted key entities and concepts. They also began to cate-\ngorize types of information (e.g., levels, characters, suggestions).\nWe realized that this dependency graph resembled a knowledge\ngraph. (Note that our explorations of knowledge graphs at this\npoint were right around the time the first KG-based solutions to\nRAG architectures were released‚Äîit was not a popular idea at the\ntime.)\nWe learned a lot from this process. First, there are‚Äúproject-\nspecific abstractions‚Äù‚Äîconcepts and terms that have specific\nmeaning to the project,some of whichare not capitalized(and\nhence may not stand out upon first glance). Project-specific abstrac-\ntions accumulate over time across interactions and become part of\n20\n\nSemantic Commit: Helping Users Update Intent Specifications for AI Memory at Scale\nFigure 10: Creating a manual knowledge graph: Design explo-\nrations on how to represent the informational dependencies\nand entities of the Labyrinth game design document.\nthe uniquecommon groundshared between parties. An example\nof this in Labyrinth was the concept of a ‚Äúwish game.‚Äù The ‚Äúwish\ngame‚Äù concept may not be recognized by a classical NER system\nas coherent, important term, since NER systems are trained on\nwell-established rather than ad-hoc terminology. Another example\nis a term like ‚Äúlabyrinth‚Äù that has a meaning in English but may be\nre-defined or differently interpreted for the project context: here,\nLabyrinth stands for the game holistically, rather than a specific\nmaze. Second, there are relations between chunks of information,\nthat can be described in a form akin to a knowledge graph, e.g. ‚Äúis\nparent of,‚Äù ‚Äúappears in,‚Äù and which connect the pieces of informa-\ntion. Third, not all information is segmented correctly (e.g., one card\nmight introduce both a new character and a monster type), empha-\nsizing the importance of chunking during pre-processing. Fourth,\nreal design documents also contain ‚Äúsuggestions,‚Äù such as remarks\nprefaced with a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù, that are not fully committed to the idea-\nspace of the project, and which we may need to treat differently\nthan fully committed information when resolving conflicts.\n11\nWe finally decided upon an LLM-induced knowledge graph ar-\nchitecture, implementing it ourselves independently before discov-\nering HippoRAG [36] and adopting their Personalized PageRank\ntechnique. The induction step uses an LLM to generate entities and\nrelations (nodes and edges), similar to the process from HippoRAG.\nThe knowledge graph is updated upon confirmation of each re-\nsolved conflict (when user pressed the green checkmark). We found\nthat this technique was effective at enhancing recall and extensible\nin that the retrieval step better scales when the information store\ngrows large, shifting from (at best) a scan of all chunks of informa-\ntionÌëÇ(Ìëõ), to a more limited filtering step after retrieval,ÌëÇ(ÌëòÌëî(Ìëõ)),\nwhich scales with thescope of conflict‚Äîhigher-degree changes, such\nas changing the setting of a game from Mars to Venus, could still\n11\nReflecting, the author who had made the Mars game design doc also discovered that\nthey had included suggestions in the doc, which hints that this may be behavior that\noccurs often in practice.\nresult in latency, but lower-degree changes, like changing a specific\ndetail of a character, are quite fast. In practice and real settings,\nusers are liable to introduce small details much more often than\nvast changes of their intent‚Äîhence, KG-retrieval is quite optimal,\nsince it is relatively low-cost and low-latency.\n12\nOur ‚Äúglobal conflict resolver‚Äù prompt that is triggered when the\nuser presses the global Make Changes button learned from the\nabove experiences. For prototype purposes, we do in this step rely\nupon the LLM to perform a rewrite of the chunks. However, we only\nfeed in theconflictingchunks‚Äîthe chunks our end-to-end pipeline\nhas flagged as potentially conflicting. We then ask the model to\nrewrite the text. This was a bit fragile, and can be improved in later\niterations; however, the key thing is that the model needs more\ncontext to not introduce repeat information when integrating the\nnew information. Here is our ‚ÄúMake Changes‚Äù prompt:\nYou are an information management system where the user has\nstored unstructured documents for a project that they are\nworking on. The user has a new piece of information they\nwish {action_instructions} the project: \"{newInfo}\"\nYou have detected that this information conflicts or\ncontradicts multiple existing pieces of information. Here\nare a list of existing texts. Edit the list as much as\nrequired to resolve the conflict. If you don't change some\ntexts, that is OK. If you want to delete a text entirely,\nmark that line with \"DELETE\". Be as conservative as possible\nin your changes. Do not repeat information. Return the\nrevised list of texts as a numbered list in Markdown format.\nReturn only the numbered list.\nTEXTS:\n{all_docs}\nwhere ‚Äúaction_type‚Äù can be either \"to add to\" or \"to integrate into.\"\nNote finally that semantic commits cannot be (fully) resolved us-\ning naive cosine similarity of vector embeddings. A naive approach\nmay be to grab the most similar embeddings and only operate\non those. Though this catches some semantic similarities, it only\ncatches the most direct. For instance, consider the statement: ‚ÄúThe\nenemy should sneak up behind the player when the enemy is not\nin the player‚Äôs field of view,‚Äù as part of the design document for\na 3D game. If the user wants to change the game plan to target a\n2D, top-down view, the semantic commit assistant should flag the\nenemy‚Äôs behavior as potentially in conflict with the new design,\nrequiring (at the very least) clarification. Embeddings alone would\nnot reveal this hidden dependency between information.\nF  Conflict Classification: Criteria‚ÄîDirect,\nAmbiguous, and Non-Conflict in the Context\nof Possible Worlds and Reference Ambiguity\nThis section describes our classification criteria for direct conflicts,\nambiguous conflicts, and non-conflicts in further detail, incorpo-\nrating essential background on issues such as possible worlds and\nreference ambiguity. Four coauthors developed this criteria over\n12\nThe caveat is that the KG needs to be initialized prior to use, which takes many LLM\ncalls to accomplish, at leastÌëÇ(Ìëõ)for the initial number of chunks. However, this is a\none-time, upfront cost.\n21\n\nVaithilingam et al.\ntime in an iterative process while creating the benchmarks and mu-\ntually decided upon these definitions. We provide this information\nfor readers who are looking to make similar benchmarks.\nF.0.1Direct Conflict.Adirect conflict, orcontradictionin NLI [48],\nrefers to a case where two statements, when evaluated within the\nsame possible world [65]‚Äîthat is, under the same common ground\nand a ‚Äúnormal interpretation‚Äù‚Äîcannot both be true simultaneously.\nIn other words, if the statements share the same context, the truth\nof one necessarily entails the falsity of the other, meaning that\nthere is no possible world, under a normal interpretation, in which\nboth statements coexist as true. This concept reflects the notion of\nthe Law of Non-Contradiction in formal logic[42], and it includes\nsituations where, even in the absence of explicit negation, people\nintuitively judge the statements as ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt make sense.‚Äù For\nexample, ‚ÄúAlice was born in 1990‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlice is 20 years old in 2025‚Äù\npresent a temporal contradiction‚Äîsince they cannot both be true\nfor the same Alice, they are classified as a direct conflict.\nF.0.2    Ambiguous Conflict.Anambiguous conflictrefers to a\nsituation where two statements appear contradictory on the sur-\nface but can be reconciled when additional context or background\nknowledge is introduced within the framework of a ‚Äúnormal in-\nterpretation.‚Äù This is similar to Chen et al.‚Äôs notion ofreference\nambiguity[13]. Under common assumptions or everyday interpre-\ntations, the two statements might seem to conflict; however, if there\nexists a reasonable possible world‚Äîwithin that normal interpreta-\ntion‚Äîin which both statements can be simultaneously true due to\nspecific circumstances or extra information, then they are consid-\nered to be in an ambiguous conflict. For example, the statements\n‚ÄúSally sold a boat to John‚Äù and ‚ÄúJohn sold a boat to Sally‚Äù generally\nappear mutually exclusive, but if each transaction pertains to a dif-\nferent boat, then there is a possible world in which both statements\nhold true. Similarly, consider ‚ÄúAlice‚Äôs father is a scientist‚Äù versus\n‚ÄúAlice‚Äôs father is a police officer.‚Äù While these intuitively seem to\nconflict, if, for instance, Alice‚Äôs father is a forensic specialist within\nthe police force or Alice has more than one parental figure that\nshe calls father, then there exists a possible world in which both\nstatements are valid. Consequently, such cases are interpreted as\nambiguous conflicts.\nF.0.3    Non-conflict.Anon-conflict, orneutralclassification in\nNLI [48], refers to situations where two statements can coexist\nwithout incident, under most normal interpretations of the world\nshared between evaluators. We define the term ‚Äúnormal interpre-\ntation‚Äù as an interpretation carried out within the common ground\nthat communicating parties share by ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù and within\nthe broad society that they share. If two statements are evaluated\nwithin the same context or possible world, and if information or\nbackground knowledge strongly suggests the possibility that they\ncan coexist, then they can be considered as not being in conflict.\nIf, however, an interpretation completely deviates from the scope\nexpected in the common world we share‚Äîsuch as when discussing\nAlice while presupposing that every Alice is a different entity, or\nwhen making claims like ‚Äúin this worldview 1+1=3‚Äù or ‚Äú100 is less\nthan 99‚Äù without any context‚Äîthen such cases would be classified\nas in conflict.\nIt is obviously true that these cannot be completely formal defi-\nnitions: the scope of ‚Äúnormal interpretation‚Äù varies from person to\nperson or situation to situation in terms of subjectivity and diversity.\nSome individuals might judge the same statements as conflicting,\nwhile others might not see any conflict. This acknowledges that the\ntruthlikeness(orverisimilitude[74]) of a statement is evaluated rela-\ntively according to individual interpretation, and under the premise\nthat completely measurable contradictions or absolute truths do not\nexist objectively, we can categorize statements into direct conflict,\nambiguous conflict, and non-conflict based only on these relative\ncriteria.\nF.0.4Example of the Difficultly and Contextual Nature of Conflict\nClassification: The Warp Drive Example.To help readers better un-\nderstand the nuances of conflict classification, consider two chunks\nof information regarding a warp drive in a game. One chunk states\nthat the warp drive can exceed the speed of light, while the other\nchunk presents a setting in which the warp drive ‚Äúfirst moves slowly\nand then suddenly operates at a very high speed.‚Äù If a new chunk\nstating ‚Äúno material can move faster than the speed of light‚Äù is\nadded, then a contradiction naturally arises with the first chunk.\nHowever, in the case of the second chunk, the question of whether\nit exceeds the speed of light and the existence of a ‚Äúvery high\nspeed‚Äù‚Äîwhich in the full context implies, but does not clearly state,\nfaster-than-light travel‚Äîare not necessarily contradictory.

While there is an increas-\ning interest in mental health care within the nat-\nural language processing community, progress\nin tackling manipulation remains limited due\nto the complexity of detecting subtle, covert\ntactics in conversations. In this paper, we pro-\npose Intent-Aware Prompting (IAP), a novel\napproach for detecting mental manipulations\nusing large language models (LLMs), provid-\ning a deeper understanding of manipulative tac-\ntics by capturing the underlying intents of par-\nticipants. Experimental results on the Mental-\nManip dataset demonstrate superior effective-\nness of IAP against other advanced prompting\nstrategies. Notably, our approach substantially\nreduces false negatives,  helping detect more\ninstances of mental manipulation with mini-\nmal misjudgment of positive cases. The code\nof this paper is available athttps://github.\ncom/Anton-Jiayuan-MA/Manip-IAP.\n1  Introduction\nHuman interactions inevitably involve varying de-\ngrees of mutual influence, from ethical persuasion\nbased on facts to more harmful tactics like coer-\ncion and manipulation (Fischer, 2022). Manipula-\ntion represents a serious concern, as it involves the\ndeliberate control or distortion of an individual‚Äôs\nthoughts and emotions for personal gain (Barnhill,\n2014). Such manipulation can lead to detrimental\nmental health issues if left unchecked. The ability\nto detect and address these behaviors swiftly and\naccurately is critical for protecting individuals from\npotential mental health deterioration and ensuring\ntheir well-being.\nLarge language models (LLMs), known for their\nexceptional capability to process and reason over\n*\nEqual contribution.\nlengthy contexts (Peng et al., 2023),  are ideally\nsuited for detecting mental manipulations. Recent\nstudies have shown the reliability of LLMs in ad-\ndressing mental health issues (Hua et al., 2024;\nNa,  2024;  Na  et  al.,  2024).   One  prominent  re-\nsearch direction involves leveraging prompt engi-\nneering techniques,  such as zero-shot,  few-shot,\nchain-of-thought (CoT), and diagnosis-of-thought\n(DoT)  prompting  (Chen  et  al.,  2023;  Schulhoff\net al., 2024), or fine-tuning the models on curated,\nannotated datasets sourced from social media plat-\nforms like Reddit and Twitter (Wang et al., 2024a;\nYang et al., 2024b; Qian et al., 2024).\nTo  advance  the  analysis  of  manipulative  dia-\nlogues,  Wang et al. (2024b) introduces the first\ndataset, MentalManip, specialized for mental ma-\nnipulation  detection  and  classification.   Despite\ntheir strengths, LLMs exhibit notable difficulties\nin identifying manipulative dialogues; in particular,\nthe false negative rate is almost twice the false pos-\nitive rate, as evidenced by our pilot study (see Sec-\ntion 2). This limitation poses a substantial problem\nfor real-world applications, where early detection\nof mental manipulation is critical. Building on this,\nYang et al. (2024a) concludes that a combination\nof few-shot and CoT prompting significantly en-\nhances performance, highlighting the necessity for\nmore advanced prompting techniques to improve\nLLM performance in this challenging task.\nIn response, we proposeIntent-Aware Prompt-\ning (IAP), a novel approach to enhance LLM‚Äôs\nTheory of Mind (ToM) and its ability in detecting\nmental manipulations from dialogues.  As shown\nin Figure 2, IAP leverages a distinct analysis of\nthe underlying intents of both participants in the\nconversation, providing a deeper understanding of\nmanipulative tactics. We perform extensive exper-\niments on the MentalManip dataset, showcasing\nthe superior effectiveness of IAP against other ad-\nvanced prompting techniques, such as few-shot and\narXiv:2412.08414v1  [cs.CL]  11 Dec 2024\n\nFalse NegativeFalse Positive\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n150\n175\n187\n96\n180\n94\nZero-shot\nFew-shot\nFigure 1: Comparison of false negatives and false posi-\ntives in mental manipulation detection using zero-shot\nand few-shot prompting.\nCoT prompting. Notably, IAP significantly reduces\nthe false negative rate, highlighting its practical rel-\nevance for early detection of mental manipulation\nin real-world applications.\nOur key contributions are as follows:  (1) the\nintroduction of IAP for detecting mental manipula-\ntion in dialogues. It improves the ToM of LLMs via\nintent summarization, thus improving model per-\nformance on the task; (2) extensive experiments on\nthe MentalManip dataset, which demonstrates that\nIAP outperforms baseline methods and substan-\ntially reduces false negatives; (3) human evaluation\nof the intent summarization process, confirming\nthe high quality of the generated intents.\n2  Observation\nIn pilot experiments using the zero-shot approach\nto detect mental manipulation (Wang et al., 2024b),\nwe observe that the false negative (FN) rate is ap-\nproximatelydoublethat of the false positive (FP)\nrate.  This indicates challenges with the model‚Äôs\nability to recognize manipulation patterns or insuf-\nficient feature representation in the input data. This\nobservation aligns with the reality that mental ma-\nnipulation is inherently difficult to detect, even for\nhumans, due to its subtle and covert nature (Barn-\nhill, 2014).  While Wang et al. (2024b) have also\nattempted to improve mental manipulation detec-\ntion using the few-shot approach, the challenge of\nperformance imbalance remains unresolved. The\nchanges in FNs and FPs between the zero-shot and\nfew-shot methods are illustrated in Figure 1.\n3  Methodology\nPsychological research suggests that individuals\nwith strong Theory of Mind (ToM) are more adept\nYou have no right to do this.\nWell if I don't who will?\nThey're happy like this.\nIntent of Person1:\nPerson1 is expressing disapproval of Person2's actions, believing that\nthey are unnecessary and that the current situation should remain\nunchanged.\nIntent Summarization\nManipulation Detection\nInclude Mental Manipulation\nIntent of Person2:\nPerson2 is challenging Person1's assertion by implying that someone\nneeds to take action to change the current situation, which they\nbelieve is not genuinely satisfying to those involved.\nDavid, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a\nsweater set.

Conversely, those\nwith ToM deficits are more susceptible to manip-\nulations (Kern et al., 2009; Lampron et al., 2024).\nLLMs have been proven to improve ToM task per-\nformance with CoT reasoning, enhancing their abil-\nity to infer complex social cues and mental states\n(Moghaddam and Honey, 2023; Chen et al., 2024).\nBuilding on these findings, we propose IAP for\nimproving the ToM of LLMs and their capability in\ndetecting mental manipulations. By incorporating\nintent-based reasoning,  our goal is to tackle the\nhigh  FN  rate  observed  in  our  pilot  experiments\n(¬ß2), by improving model ability to detect subtle\nmanipulative behavior that might be neglected. In\nthis section, we present two key components for\nimplementing IAP ‚Äì Intent Summarization (¬ß3.1)\nand Manipulation Detection (¬ß3.2). Figure 2 shows\nan overview of Intent-Aware Prompting.\n3.1  Intent Summarization\nConsider we have a conversationD, structured as:\nD={u\nA1\n,u\nB1\n, . . . ,u\nAn\n,u\nBn\n},\nwhereu\nA\nrepresents utterances by Person A and\nu\nB\nrepresents utterances by Person B.

The promptP\nMD\nis specifically de-\nsigned to evaluate the interaction between the two\nintent summaries and detect potential manipulation\nbehaviors in the conversation. The detailed prompt\nis provided in Appendix A.\n4  Experiments\n4.1  Experimental Settings\nDataset.We conducted experiments using the\nMentalManip dataset (Wang et al., 2024b), which\nprovides multi-level annotations aimed at detecting\nand classifying mental manipulations. It consists\nof 4,000 multi-turn fictional dialogues between two\ncharacters derived from online movie scripts and\nincludes annotation across three dimensions:  the\npresence of manipulation, manipulation technique,\nand targeted vulnerability. For our experiments, we\nsampled a subset with 30% instances (1.5 times\nof the original test set) in MentalManip\ncon\n, a sub-\nset of MentalManip with full annotator consensus,\nensuring high quality and consistency in the exper-\nimented data.\nEvaluation Metrics.Following   Wang   et   al.\n(2024b),  we  evaluated  performance  using  accu-\nracy, precision, recall, and F1-score (weighted and\nmacro). Furthermore, the analysis of the false pre-\ndictions, including false negatives (FN) and false\npositives  (FP),  is  also  crucial,  as  it  provides  in-\nsights on how well the method works to identify\npsychologically manipulated dialogues without ex-\ncessively exaggerating the presence of the positive\nclass.\nBaselines.In accordance with the previous work,\nwe compared the performance of IAP against the\nfollowing  baselines:  (1)Zero-shot prompting,\nwhich enables LLMs to perform the task based\nsolely on the given input. (2)Few-shot prompting\n(Brown et al., 2020), which generalizes LLMs to\nthe task by providing a few examples within the in-\nput prompt. We randomly selected three examples\nfrom the data subset not used for testing, with a pro-\nportion of 1:2 of manipulative to non-manipulative.\n(3)Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting(Kojima\net  al.,  2022),  which  enhances  LLM‚Äôs  reasoning\ncapabilities by generating intermediate reasoning\nsteps within its output, enabling more complicated\nproblem-solving and decision-making processes.\n4.2  Experimental Results\nMain Results.Table 1 illustrates the experimen-\ntal results of IAP against baselines, in which GPT-\n4\n1\n(OpenAI, 2024) was utilized in all experiments.\n1\ngpt-4-1106-preview\n\nRating Category   Percentage\nAccurate82%\nInaccurate18%\nTable 2:  Percentage of intents rated as accurate and\ninaccurate based on human evaluation.\nFrom the table, we observed the effectiveness of\nIAP on mental manipulation detection by achiev-\ning the best performance on nearly all evaluation\nmetrics, demonstrating substantial improvements\nin accuracy (+7.2%), recall (+13.6%), weighted\nF1-score (+6.0%),  and macro F1-score (+5.5%)\ncompared with zero-shot prompting.  This under-\nscores the potent efficacy of analyzing speakers‚Äô\nintentions in identifying the existence of mental ma-\nnipulation within dialogues and the improvement\nof the ToM of the model.  Besides, IAP achieved\nthe lowest number of false negatives (130), repre-\nsenting a 30.5% reduction compared to zero-shot\nprompting and substantially outperforming other\nbaseline methods, reinforcing its ability to detect\na higher number of mental manipulative dialogues.\nWhile there is a trade-off with an increase in false\npositives  (+14.6%),  the  substantial  reduction  in\nfalse negatives is far more critical, where early de-\ntection and intervention for potential mental health\nconcerns are much more paramount.\nHuman Evaluation of Generated Intents.To\nassess the quality of the generated intents in the\nabsence of references, we conducted a human eval-\nuation to verify whether they correctly identified\nthe manipulators. We selected 50 dialogues from\nthe  dataset  that  exhibited  mental  manipulations,\nand two annotators independently assessed each\ndialogue, labeling Person A, Person B, or both as\nthe manipulator(s). The inter-annotator agreement\nreached 74%, and the discrepancies were resolved\nthrough discussion to reach a consensus.  During\nevaluation, we verified if the generated intents ac-\ncurately pointed to the labeled manipulator(s). As\nshown in Table 2, 82% of the intents correctly iden-\ntified the manipulator(s), demonstrating the capa-\nbility of IAP in producing high-quality intents that\nsignificantly aid in the detection of manipulations.\nSome examples are in Appendix B.\n5  Related Work\nMental  Manipulation  Detection.Dialogue-\nbased classification poses unique challenges due\nto  the  dynamic,  multi-turn  nature  of  conversa-\ntions.   These  challenges  include  handling  long\ntext sequences, managing context shifts, capturing\nspeaker roles and intents, and modeling nuanced\ninteractions across multiple turns. In mental health-\ncare, dialogue-based classification has been primar-\nily used for identifying mental health conditions\n(Hua et al., 2024) and detecting toxic behaviors\n(Ozoh et al., 2019), including threats, obscenity, in-\nsults, identity-based hate, harassment, and socially\ndisruptive persuasion (Sheth et al., 2022).\nHowever, the research on mental manipulation\nremains underexplored.  The only existing work\n(Yang et al., 2024a) investigates prompting tech-\nniques for mental manipulation detection with lim-\nited standard prompting techniques. Different from\nthe previous work, we introduce a novel approach\nfor by analyzing underlying intents of both partici-\npants in the conversation, offering a deeper under-\nstanding of manipulative tactics.\nLLMs and Theory of Mind.LLMs with excep-\ntional capability to process and reason over lengthy\ncontexts have become the cornerstone of numerous\nNLP tasks (Peng et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024c),\nmaking them particularly well-suited for dialogue-\nbased applications (Na et al., 2024; Lee et al., 2024;\nZheng et al., 2024a,b; Iftikhar et al., 2024), which\nrequire comprehending not only individual turns\nbut also the evolution of context, tone, and intent\nthroughout the conversations.\n‚ÄúTheory of Mind‚Äù (ToM) refers to the ability to\ninfer and understand the mental states, intentions,\nbeliefs, and emotions of others. While traditionally\nregarded a human cognitive trait, recent research\nsuggests that LLMs can simulate aspects of this\nability, even surpassing humans in tasks like rec-\nognizing irony and false beliefs (Strachan et al.,\n2024). This capability is particularly valuable for\nmental manipulation detection, where accurately\ninterpreting and predicting speakers‚Äô intentions and\nemotional states is essential for uncovering manip-\nulative strategies in dialogues (Kern et al., 2009;\nLampron et al., 2024).\n6  Conclusion\nWe introduced Intent-Aware Prompting (IAP), a\nnovel approach to enhance LLM‚Äôs ability in de-\ntecting mental manipulations from dialogues.  It\nenhanced LLM‚Äôs ToM and its manipulation detec-\ntion capability by distinctly analyzing the under-\nlying intents of both participants, offering a more\nnuanced understanding of manipulative strategies.\n\nThrough comprehensive experiments on the Men-\ntalManip dataset, IAP consistently outperformed\nother advanced prompting techniques, such as few-\nshot and CoT prompting, across multiple metrics.\nNotably, it achieved a substantial reduction in false\nnegatives, a crucial improvement in the context of\nmental health support systems where early detec-\ntion of psychological manipulation is key to timely\ninterventions.  In the future, we will expand IAP\nto broader mental health applications to more real-\nworld scenarios.\nLimitations\nThe limitations of this paper are as follows:  (1)\nAlthough performance increased, the reduction in\nfalse negatives led to a slight increase in false pos-\nitives.  While its real-world impact is minimal, it\nmight introduce therapeutic costs. Future research\ncan focus on optimizing the trade-off between false\nnegatives and false positives. (2) Due to only one\ndataset available, we only tested the performance\nof IAP on the MentalManip dataset.   Future re-\nsearch can develop more diverse mental manipu-\nlation datasets encompassing both high-resource\nand low-resource languages and validate the gen-\neralizability of IAP across different linguistic and\ncontextual settings.\nReferences\nAnne Barnhill. 2014.

However, when studentsinteract with\nchat interfaces, they expect dialogue-driven navigation from the system\nand can express frustration and disinterest if this is not provided. In-\ntent detection systems help students navigate within an ITS, but de-\ntecting students‚Äô intent during open-ended dialogue is challenging. We\ndesigned an intent detection system in a chatbot ITS, classifying a stu-\ndent‚Äôs intent between continuing the current lesson or switching to a\nnew lesson. We explore the utility of four machine learning approaches\nfor this task‚Äîincluding both conventional classification approaches and\nfine-tuned large language models‚Äîfinding that using an intent classifier\nintroduces trade-offs around implementation cost, accuracy, and predic-\ntion time. We argue that implementing intent detection in chat interfaces\ncan reduce frustration and support student learning.\nKeywords:classification ¬∑ intelligent tutoring systems ¬∑ large language\nmodels ¬∑ intent detection.\n1  Introduction\nSome intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) use chat interfaces to allow for flexi-\nble student inputs. Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated\nwithin ITSs as chatbots that process student‚Äôs text inputs to generate conver-\nsational responses [30,14]. LLMs are appealing for their potential to generate\nresponsive, contextually-relevant output this is grounded in pedagogical goals.\nHowever, integrating LLMs into ITSs is not easy: ITSs need totrack and update\ninternal state in order to provide safe, structured pedagogical experiences [29].\nChat interfaces carry with them an expectation of dialogue-driven navigation,\nand students can become disinterested or frustrated if their messages fail to up-\ndate the ITS‚Äôs internal state appropriately. Our research team observed many\nfrustrated messages from students using the conversational lesson feature we in-\nvestigate in this study: students expected to be able to change the current task\nwith minimal context, prompting us to develop a classifier todetermine when a\nuser wants to change lessons. This classification task is calledintent detection.\nIntent detection is the problem of determining a user‚Äôs intent from their\nmessages to a system and is required for tracking internal state accurately in\n\n2E. Cutler et al.\nsystems with chat interfaces [9,18,13]. In contrast with ‚Äúopen‚Äù intent detection\nsystems that attempt to identifyanyintent [17,32], the structured nature of\nITSs suggests a focus on a limited set of intents or intent categories [1]. The\ndetection of specific intents is tightly coupled to the educational context [28,21];\na one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to be effective or toalign with the internal\nstate tracked by a specific ITS. Intent detection is related to affect detection [3],\nbut is focused on detecting states that correspond to specific system actions.\nIn this paper, we describe the practical development of an intent detection\nsystem within an existing chatbot ITS. We compare four different modeling\napproaches, identifying trade-offs between intent detection accuracy and infer-\nence speed, both critical metrics for real-time chat interfaces. We argue that\nimplementing intent detection in chat-based ITSs is critical for reducing student\nfrustration and that crafting automated conversational experiences with LLMs\nrequires pedagogical choices about when and how students can navigate within\nan ITS.\n2  Educational Context & Data\nDigital Harbor Foundation formed a research collaborationwith the developers\nof Rori, an intelligent tutoring system for middle-school math learning.\n3\nRori is\nan English-language chatbot accessed via WhatsApp that is predominantly used\nin West Africa [10]. In 2024, Rori began presenting new student users with con-\nversations focused on building meta-cognitive skills and confidence before math\npractice begins [14]. In summer 2024, all new students participated in a conver-\nsation with the GPT-3.5 large language model about the history of mathematics\nin Africa. The conversation uses the highly-structured design of the Rori conver-\nsations described by Levonian et al. [14] but is focused on West African math\nhistory rather than cultivating a growth mindset. Table 1 shows the phases of the\nconversation. The conversation structure and content was designed by educators\non the Rori team using culturally relevant pedagogy approaches [22,6].\nIn July and August 2024, students completed this math history conversation\n2,101 times, sending 10,504 messages. This conversation presents a pedagogical\ndesign problem: what should the system do when a student saysthey want to do\nsomething else or expresses frustration with the current conversation? The LLM\nprompt tries to guide students with disengaged or slightly off-topic responses\nback to the topic at hand, and a moderation system responds tomore serious\nnegative content such as violent messages [14]. A challenging middle ground is\nmessages that indicate a desire to change the topic of the conversations. How\nshould the system respond in a way that is pedagogically appropriate [25]? We\napproach this as a binary classification problem that can be learned from annota-\ntions produced by educators. We train machine learning classifiers to distinguish\nbetween messages that should be handled by the LLM and messages that in-\ndicate an intent to Change Topic. Messages with the Change Topic intent are\n3\nhttps://rori.ai\n\nDetecting Student Intent for Chat-Based Intelligent Tutoring Systems3\nTable 1.Math history conversation phases and example on-topic messages. Descrip-\ntions are representative of the content presented to students at each phase, but they\nwill vary based on a student‚Äôs responses and questions.\nPhase Description\nExample\nResponses\n1 We will learn about the history of mathematics in this lesson,\nwith a focus on African civilizations. Interesting, isn‚Äôt it?\nyes, yh, okay\n2 How old do you think maths is?100yrs, forever\n3 Did you know ancient African civilizations played an important\npart in the development of mathematics?\nno, yes, how\n4 The Mali empire in modern West Africa advanced the knowledge\nof mathematics through its University of Sankore in Timbuktu.\nWould you have liked to study there?\nyes, maybe, one\nday, where is\nthat?\n5 The Bamana Code‚Äîdeveloped and used in Africa historically‚Äîis\nthe foundation of digital computers. Do you find that exciting?\nyes, no, tell me\nmore, what is\nthat\n6 Are you proud of your African heritage and contributions tothe\nfield of math now?\nyes, no\nrouted not to the next phase of the conversation, but treatedas an opportunity\nto navigate the student to a new topic‚Äîa fundamentally different module within\nthe ITS.\nWe randomly sampled 806 student messages sent during the math history\nconversation between 1 July 2024 and 28 August 2024. These messages occur in\n208 unique conversations and comprise 7.7% of student messages sent in that\nperiod. 157 students in the annotated sample self-reporteda country of origin‚Äî\n82% said they were from either Nigeria or Ghana. 141 studentsself-reported an\nage‚Äîmedian 19 years old, with 30% of students under the age of 18.\nTwo of the authors mutually annotated 224 messages, finding acceptable\nagreement (94.6% agreement, Cohen‚ÄôsŒ∫=0.68). The annotators met to resolve\ndisagreements and then independently annotated the remaining messages. 69\n(8.56%) of annotated messages indicated an early exit. Qualitatively, many of\nthese messages expressed explicit frustration with the system. Other messages\nannotated with the Change Topic intent don‚Äôt show frustration, e.g. ‚ÄúPls can we\ngo straight to the teaching‚Äù, ‚Äúteach me mathematics‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhatis the LCM of 16‚Äù,\n‚ÄúI want to stop‚Äù, ‚ÄúCan u solve math question 4 me‚Äù.\n3  Methods\nWe evaluated four modeling approaches for the binary intentclassification task.\nAnnotated data was randomly split into training (60%), validation (20%) and\ntest (20%) sets. All hyperparameter tuning was conducted with the validation\n\n4E. Cutler et al.\nset and all results are reported on the test set. We release all analysis and\nfine-tuning code as well as LLM prompts used.\n4\nModels are compared by their\nclassification performance (average F1, precision, and recall) and the inference\ntime for processing a single message (in seconds). Inference time is an important\ncomponent of a real-time ITS user‚Äôs quality of experience: slow responses can\nlead to disengagement.\nOur first modeling approach is a conventional, non-LLM machine learning\nclassifier. We used scikit-learn‚Äôs random forest implementation with TF-IDF as\na strong and fast baseline [23]. We tuned hyperparameters onthe validation set\nusing Hyperopt [2].\nOur second modeling approach is a self-hosted LLM fine-tunedfor the clas-\nsification task. We used the Llama 2 model with 70 billion parameters already\nfine-tuned for chat use cases [27]. We fine-tuned Llama 2 for 20epochs on a sin-\ngle NVIDIA T4 GPU with 16GB of memory using PEFT‚Äôs implementation of\nLoRA [19,11]. We set fine-tuning hyperparameters based on existing open-source\nimplementations [26]. We train a classifier on top of the fine-tuned LoRA model\nuntil loss convergence.\nOur third modeling approach is to use LLMs hosted via a third-party API.\nUse of an API is convenient and enables access to models that may exceed the\ncapabilities of open-source LLMs available for self-hosting, but use of an API\ncall will increase inference time. We evaluated with OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5, GPT-\n4o, GPT-4o Mini, and o3-mini models. As the conversational context requires\na response if the Change Topic intent is not detected, we embed the intent\nclassification problem in the prompt: ‚ÄúIf the user indicatesthat they want to\nexit the conversation or change the topic, reply with the text <exit> instead of\nresponding to the student.‚Äù We did minimal prompt engineering.\nOur fourth modeling approach is the use of function calling with OpenAI‚Äôs\nLLMs. Function calling involves fine-tuning an LLM to outputthat a function\nshould be called in certain circumstances rather than generating the expected\nconversational response [4]. In this case, a function description for a Change\nTopic request can be provided to the LLM as an alternative to aseparate intent\nclassification step or a pre-specified text.\n5\nWe evaluate the use of function calling\nfor all OpenAI models. Function calling has previously beenused for dialogue\nstate tracking [15].\n4  Results\nTable 2 shows performance and inference speed using different models. A well-\ntuned conventional machine learning approach achieves a 0.62 F1 score, indi-\ncating that the underlying classification task is challenging. Fine-tuned Llama 2\nimproves F1 score to 0.66, at the cost of an increased per-message inference time\nfrom less than 0.01 seconds to 0.035 seconds on average.\n4\nhttps://github.com/DigitalHarborFoundation/its-intent-detection\n5\nFunction description: ‚ÄúThis function logs that the user wishes to change the topic of\nconversation from the current discussion to something unrelated.‚Äù\n\nDetecting Student Intent for Chat-Based Intelligent Tutoring Systems5\nTable 2.Performance of various modeling approaches.

All OpenAImodels take\naround 1 second to retrieve a classification, with the exception of the reasoning\nmodel o3-mini which offers both slower response times and worse performance on\nthis task. The function calling approach performs similarly to the basic prompt-\ning approach, suggesting that either approach is reasonable for this task.\n5  Discussion\nIntent detection is a critical modeling task for ITSs that incorporate LLMs into\nchat-like interfaces. We find only modest performance on thespecific binary\nclassification task we investigated here; any of these models will produce many\nmisclassifications that will need to be gracefully handled by the ITS. As LLMs\nproliferate within ITSs, the use of iterative dialogue flowsfor confirmation and\nnavigation are an important focus area for future design work. Within Rori,\nwe intend to handle messages differently based on the intent detection clas-\nsifier‚Äôs confidence, handling high-confidence messages without clarification but\npresenting confirmatory dialogue turns when classifier confidence is low. This is a\ndownside to the use of third-party LLMs for intent detectionproblems: their rel-\native lack of calibrated confidence estimates. Incorporating research on probing\nmodels for their certainty [12,7] might enable the wider useof LLM-based intent\ndetection models. During internal development, access to calibrated probability\nestimates also enables the use of model comparison metrics more appropriate for\ndialogue classification tasks, such as ROC AUC [16].\nThe binary intent detection task we considered here is fundamentally lim-\nited; conversational interfaces require designing for theflexibility in human con-\nversations [31]. Xu et al. characterize existing conversational user interfaces as\nproviding mere ‚Äúpsuedo-conversations‚Äù, as systems lack the technical infrastruc-\n\n6E. Cutler et al.\nture for collaborative conversation [31]. In our view, the same critique applies to\nLLM-backed ITSs: conducting meaningful conversational lessons requires both\ndetecting a wide variety of intents and providing an appropriate system response\nto each detected intent. In other words, knowing that a student wants to change\ntopics within an ITS is only the beginning of designing navigational capabilities\nthat align with the pedagogical guardrails that human tutors apply instinctively.\nChat interfaces should demonstrate the extent to which theycan facilitate var-\nious student intents by making some internal state visible,avoiding needless\nanthropomorphization [5], and teaching student users about what capabilities\nare provided. In other cases, chat interfaces can be supplemented or replaced\nentirely with more traditional interfaces, which excel at presenting a uniform\nview of information and responding predictably to users‚Äô inputs.\nOur modeling results demonstrate trade-offs between inference time‚Äîex-\nperienced directly as response latency by users‚Äîand intent detection accuracy.\nWhile an increase in response latency is often perceived as negative from a user\nexperience perspective [24], the impact of delayed responses in chat interfaces is\nless clear [8]. ITS designers should carefully consider theimpact of delaying a\nresponse in order to ensure a more appropriate response.\nThis preliminary investigation has many limitations. Our test dataset con-\nsists of only 162 messages, which makes fine-grained comparison between models\nimprecise. Computing standard errors is challenging because messages are clus-\ntered within conversations; our future work will use cross validation and clus-\ntered standard errors to enable more reliable model comparison [20]. Further,\nthe generalizability of these results is unclear: we studied only a single binary\nintent detection task. Future work should investigate a broader set of intents\nand explore the degree to which particular intent models canbe applied in other\nITSs [1]. Intent detection is an important problem because it directly impacts\nuser experience, but we did not collect any user experience metrics in this study.\nModeling results should be contextualized through usability studies that inves-\ntigate the impact of these models on student use when these intent detection\nsystems are deployed in the wild.\nAcknowledgments.We would like to thank Owen Henkel, Millie-Ellen Postle, Maria\nDyshel, Greg Thompson, Bill Roberts, and the staff of Rising Academies.

Existing approaches, such as zero-shot reformulations\nand LLM-based dynamic recognition, struggle with performance degradation when\nencountering unseen intents, leading to erroneous task routing.  To enhance the\nmodel‚Äôs generalization performance on unseen tasks, we employ Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) combined with a Reward-based Curriculum Sampling (RCS) during\nGroup Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training in intent detection tasks. Ex-\nperiments demonstrate that RL-trained models substantially outperform supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) baselines in generalization. Besides, the introduction of the RCS,\nsignificantly bolsters the effectiveness of RL in intent detection by focusing the\nmodel on challenging cases during training.

Consequently,  the intent\ndetection models are expected to efficiently adapt to evolving task priorities and requirements, so as\nto conduct dynamic task allocation among multiple agents in complicated application scenarios.\nThe recent development of LLMs has accelerated the evolution of TOD systems, and with the rapid\niteration of integrable artificial API tools [5,6], the number of AI tools that can be incorporated into\nTOD systems is increasing. This situation leads to a great challenge that, actually, intent detection\nmodels need to flexibly adapt to newly introduced tools for unseen tasks, with no timely incremental\ntraining processes. In many cases, tools within the management of intent detection modules maintain\ncomplex interrelationships, such as functional similarity, overlapping, inclusion, etc.  Thus, the\ngeneralization of intent detection models is the essence for TOD systems to adjust to complicated\npractical scenarios, in which a number of tools, with complex relationships and interactions, may be\nfrequently involved.\nPrevious studies have made much efforts to improve the accuracy of intent detection models by\nadopting new tools to handle unseen tasks.  For example, the model proposed by Siddique et al.\nintroduces external common sense knowledge to address this problem [7]. Comi et al.[8] reformatted\nthe tasks in an NLI format to achieve zero-shot capability.  Moreover, LLM-based models [9,1]\ndynamically  recognized  unknown  tasks  by  capitalizing  on  their  inherent  zero-shot  capabilities.\nHowever, these models often experienced significant performance degradation in intent detection\nmodels when confronted with unseen or new intent, resulting in the system incorrectly routing user\nintent to the unmatched agent. This situation indicates that enhancing the generalization of intent\ndetection models is particularly critical.\nReinforcement learning has been proved to be valuable in improving the generalization of LLMs\n[10], which has also been supported by the exceptional cross-task generalization of the recent model\nDeepSeek-R1 [11]. Inspired by the principle of DeepSeek-R1, we propose to apply the Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO) methodology to enhance the generalization of the intent detection model.\nIn particular, to ensure that the R1-style RL process achieves expected performances on the intent\ndetection problem,  a sampling strategy is presented in this work.  As depicted in Figure 1,  the\nexperimental results demonstrate that in varying generalization scenarios, the reinforcement learning\n(RL) model successfully predicts user query intents, significantly outperforming the supervised\nfine-tuned (SFT) model.  This superiority is particularly evident in terms of generalization across\nunseen intents, subdivided intents, grouped intents, and cross-language.  In conclusion, our work\noffers the following findings:\n‚Ä¢We demonstrate that models trained with RL significantly outperform those trained with SFT\non the intent detection problem, in terms of generalization across unseen intents, subdivided\nintents, grouped intents, and cross-language.\n‚Ä¢To stimulate the capability of GRPO training, we introduce the Rewards-based Curriculum\nSampling Strategy, which is found to be valuable for enabling models to focus more on\nchallenging cases during the training process.\n‚Ä¢Incorporating COT [12] processes during reinforcement learning significantly enhances\nmodel generalization on complex intent detection tasks, highlighting the importance of\nthought processes for improving generalization in challenging scenarios.\n‚Ä¢Furthermore, our experiments also show that even a base model without instruction training\ncan achieve performance comparable to the instruction model on the intent detection task.\nThis finding suggests that the Function Call capability of the base model may not be a\nnecessary prerequisite for intent detection models trained with RL.\n2    Method\n2.1    Task Formulation\nIn task-oriented dialogue systems, accurate detection of user intents is essential for dialogue state\ntracking and subsequent API execution. We formulate the intent detection task as follows: Given a\n2\n\ndialogue historyH={(u\n1\n,a\n1\n,y\n1\n),(u\n2\n,a\n2\n,y\n2\n),...,(u\nt‚àí1\n,a\nt‚àí1\n,y\nt‚àí1\n)}, whereu\ni\n,a\ni\n, andy\ni\n‚ààY\nrepresent the user‚Äôs utterance, the assistant‚Äôs response, and the ground truth intent label at turn\ni, respectively.Y={c\n1\n,c\n2\n,...,c\nK\n}denotes a predefined set ofKactionable intents related to\ndomain-specific operations, with each intentc\ni\nassociated with a natural language descriptiond\ni\nin\nthe prompt. The objective of an intent detection modelMis to accurately predict the intenty\nt\n‚ààY\nof the current user‚Äôs utteranceu\nt\n. Formulated as:\nL(Œ∏) =‚àí\n1\nN\nN\nX\nn=1\nlogP\nŒ∏\n(y\nn\nt\n|H\nn\n,u\nn\nt\n,d\n1\n,d\n2\n,...,d\nK\n)(1)\nwhereŒ∏represents the parameters of modelM,Nis the number of training examples,P\nŒ∏\ndenotes\nthe probability assigned by modelM.\nApparently, the modelMdemonstrates non-trivial generalization potential for evolving dialogue\nsystems, as its architecture theoretically supports the discovery of novel intent categories through\ndynamic prompt engineering. Formally, fory\nt\n=c\nK+1\n/‚ààY, modelMcan add the descriptiond\nK+1\nofc\nK+1\nto the prompt to predicty\nt\n. In particular, thisy\nt\nmay represent not only a completely new\ncategory distinct fromY, but also potentially a division or recombination of previous categories.\n2.2    Intent Detection via Reinforcement Learning\nDirectly applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to learn the prediction ofy\nt\nhas been a conventional\napproach, however, this method often suffers from poor generalization capabilities.  In this paper,\ninspired by DeepSeek-R1-Zero [11], which demonstrated the significant potential of reinforcement\nlearning combined with model reasoning, we design rule-based rewards and exclusively employ\nGRPO [13] to guide model training.\nSpecifically, building upon an arbitrary LLM, we construct a complete prompt using the ReAct\nPrompting [14] method, where the system prompt is \"You are a helpful assistant.\". In the final turn\nof the dialogue, we insert an instruction composed of the user query and other relevant information,\nsuch as descriptions of available tools. The specific instruction template is as follows.\nInstruction Template of ReAct Prompting\nYou are an agent that helps users choose the right tool or tools from the list of given tools to solve their problems.\nFor  each  tool,  you  are  first  given  its  description  and  required  parameters.    Then,  a  logic  module  specifically  explains  the  logical  information\nneeded for this tool to handle multi-turn conversation issues.\n## Tool APIs\n{tools text}\n## Task Logic\n{logic text}\n## Output Format\nUse the following format:\nLast Tool: the tool used in last query\nQuestion: the input question you must answer\nThought: you should always think about what to do\nAction: the action to take\nFinish!\nBegin!\nLast Tool:{tool}\nQuestion:{query}\nRegarding the training objectives, we design two rule-based reward functions to guide reinforcement\nlearning training.   Specifically,  these include a Format Reward to constrain the model‚Äôs output\nstructure and an Answer Reward to evaluate the correctness of intent detection.\nR=Œª\nformat\n¬∑R\nformat\n+Œª\nanswer\n¬∑R\nanswer\n(2)\nwhereŒª\nformat\nandŒª\nanswer\nare weighting coefficients for each respective reward component.\nFormat RewardWe restrict the model‚Äôs output to strictly follow a fixed format, as specified in the\nInstruction Template of ReAct Prompting. Specifically, the model‚Äôs output must strictly conform to a\n3\n\nthree-line structure where each line begins with ‚ÄúThought:‚Äù, ‚ÄúAction:‚Äù, and ‚ÄúFinish!‚Äù respectively.\nEach of these keywords must appear exactly once in the entire output and the content of the third line\nis limited to solely ‚ÄúFinish!‚Äù.\nR\nformat\n=\n\u001a\n1,if format is correct\n0,otherwise\nAccuracy RewardThe accuracy-based reward is a binary metric that evaluates the exact match\nbetween the predicted intentÀÜy\nt\nand the ground truth labely\nt\n. We employ a regular expression-based\nmethod to extract the predicted intent from the model‚Äôs output.\nR\nanswer\n=\n\u001a\n1,if the answerÀÜy\nt\nfully matches the ground truthy\nt\n0,otherwise\n2.3    Reward-Based Curriculum Sampling\nResearch indicates that low reward variance leads to a flat landscape in the RLHF objective, resulting\nin suboptimal convergence [15]. Our observations on intent detection tasks reveal that GRPO-trained\nmodels converge remarkably quickly, reaching accuracy comparable to SFT models within dozens of\ntraining steps. Consequently, in subsequent training phases, the reward variance becomes extremely\nsmall, and the model‚Äôs focus on challenging examples diminishes. To address this issue, we employ an\noffline Reward-based Curriculum Sampling Strategy to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness\nof the training process.\nOffline Reward CollectionTo select the most challenging sample for RL, we first apply the\nGRPO method to the entire training dataset, recording the rewards for each data accross all samples\nthroughout the GRPO training process. Just as shown in Eq 3, theGrepresents the sampling number\nof each data,R\ni,j\nrepresents the reward ofj-th sampling of thei-th data, and theScore\ni\nrepresents\nthe score ofi-th data.\nScore\ni\n=\nG\nX\nj=1\n(Œª\nformat\n¬∑R\ni,j\nformat\n+Œª\nanswer\n¬∑R\ni,j\nanswer\n)(3)\nCurriculum SamplingAfter obtaining the training rewards for each sample, we employ a two-\nstage training method. In the first stage, we train the model for dozens of steps on the entire dataset\nuntil the accuracy on the validation set changes less than a certain threshold. We intentionally avoid\nusing easier data during this initial stage because the model demonstrated significantly low rewards\nacross all examples at the beginning of the training process.  In addition, this approach facilitates\nthe transition of our proposed method to an online format in subsequent work. In the second stage,\nwe define thei-th data is challenging when theScore\ni\n<(Œª\nformat\n+Œª\nanswer\n)‚àóG.  We select the\nchallenging data to continue training the model trained in the first stage. This approach allows the\nmodel to concentrate on these difficult examples during the second stage.\n3    Experimental Setup\n3.1    Dataset\nWe conduct experiments on two task-oriented dialogue datasets.\nThe first dataset is the widely used MultiWOZ benchmark, specifically a subset ofMultiWOZ 2.2\n[16].  This large-scale multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset contains 10,437 conversations\nspanning 7 domains.  These domains encompass tasks that require multiple interaction turns to\ncomplete, such as flight booking and hotel reservations.  We extract the intent subtask from this\ndataset for training and evaluation of our proposed method.\nAdditionally, considering the rapid iteration of integrable artificial API tools, we construct a dataset\nthat simulates interactions with a general AI assistant that integrates various task capabilities, named\n4\n\nTODAssistant.  This dataset encompasses 10 task categories, including traditional task-oriented\nfunctions such as signature settings, friend recommendations, and chatbot recommendations, as\nwell as AI-driven task types, including text-to-image generation, image style transformation, and\ntext-based conversation.  All dialogue data for these tasks were simulated using GPT-4o [17] to\ngenerate conversations representing possible interaction scenarios for each tool, with specific details\nomitted here. In summary, this is a task-oriented dialogue dataset containing 10 tasks, covering both\ntraditional task-oriented dialogue-focused areas and emerging AI-driven tasks. The data is entirely\ngenerated by LLMs and comprises 9,500 training samples and 500 test samples.\nTo better evaluate model adaptability to situations involving new domains, subdivided, or grouped\ntasks, we further develop three generalization test sets with new intents that are not included in the\nknown 10 categories:\n‚Ä¢TODAssistant-Unseen5:  Introduces 5 completely novel tasks not encountered in the dataset,\nincluding singing children‚Äôs songs and storytelling, which are oriented toward children‚Äôs scenarios.\n‚Ä¢TODAssistant-Subdivided:  For the text chat task already included in the 10 categories, we\ndivide it into three more granular intents to simulate real-world scenarios where finer-grained\ncapabilities might better address specific user needs. Specifically, we split the text chat task into:\n‚ÄìVarious text processing intents: Covering purpose-specific text generation tasks including\ntranslation, text classification, text generation, mathematical calculation, and code generation.\n‚ÄìSafety topics: Involving content related to pornography, violence, etc.\n‚ÄìFree topic conversation: Chit-chat or intents not belonging to the other two categories.\n‚Ä¢TODAssistant-Grouped: This set simulates situations where, due to agent upgrades, multiple\npreviously separate tasks may be completed by a single agent.  Specifically, we regroup two\nrelatively similar intents ‚Äî \"friend recommendations\" and \"chatbot recommendations\" into a\nsingle intent.\nTo  clarify,  TODAssistant-Unseen5  introduces  5  entirely  new  task  categories,  TODAssistant-\nSubdivided uses a portion of the test samples originally belonging to the text chat task and divides\nthem into three new intents, and TODAssistant-Grouped modifies the intent of two test set categories\ninto one new intent.  It is important to emphasize that none of these categories were encountered\nduring the training process.\n3.2    Setup\nWe selected Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct\n3\n[18] as our foundation model, which represents a widely adopted\nopen-source large language model.\nFor the MultiWOZ2.2 dataset, we utilize the10kconversations to conduct reinforcement learning.\nWe conduct 60 steps for the first stage of the curriculum learning, and 1 epoch (153 steps) for the\nsecond stage.  For both of the two stages, we train our model with a learning rage of9.0‚àó10\n‚àí6\n,\nincorporating a sampling strategy that generated 7 responses per prompt at a temperature parameter\nof 0.7. In the case of the TODAssistant dataset, we employ the entire training set for our experiments.\nWe train the model with a learning rage of3.0‚àó10\n‚àí6\n, incorporating a sampling strategy that generated\n7 responses per prompt at a temperature parameter of 0.9. For all the datasets, we utilize a global\nbatch size of 448 for our training.\nRegarding the supervised fine-tuning approach, we fully fine-tune the model with the same epoch of\nthe corresponding GRPO-based method. On both datasets, we employAccuracyas the metric to\nmeasure the effectiveness of intent detection.\n4    Experiments\n4.1    Comparison of Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Fine-Tuning Effects\nWe conduct intent detection training on two datasets using both GRPO and SFT approaches.

It is important to note that the\nGRPO training discussed in this subsection corresponds to the methodology described in Section 2.1,\nwhich does not incorporate curriculum learning. Our primary objective is to analyze the performance\ndifferences between models trained using GRPO versus those trained through standard SFT.\n4.1.1    Performance on In-Domain Test Set\nAs shown in Table 1, both SFT and GRPO-trained models significantly improve intent recognition\nperformance on in-domain categories. However, using only RL (GRPO) on the same training data\nas SFT does not surpass SFT‚Äôs performance on in-domain testing. While both approaches achieve\ncomparable convergence results on the more complex MultiWOZ 2.2 dataset, GRPO performs slightly\nworse on the machine-generated TODAssistant dataset.\n4.1.2    Performance in generalization scenarios\nTo assess the performance of RL methodologies across various generalization scenarios, we conduct\na comparative analysis of the GRPO model and the SFT model, focusing on their adaptability as the\nintent label set progressively evolves and deviates from the training dataset.\nTable 3 shows performance on the three generalization test sets of TODAssistant. Compared to the\nuntuned Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the performance of the SFT model shows a notable decline\nacross all three test sets. This deterioration is especially evident on the Subdivided and Grouped test\nsets, where the SFT-trained model limits its predictions to the 10 categories seen during training,\n6\n\nTable 3: Results of the out-of-domain evaluation on TODAssistant dataset\nModelTODAssistantUnseen5SubdividedGroupedAvg\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct-63.040.221.641.6\n+ SFT-44.50.00.014.8\n+ GRPO-90.683.193.689.1\n+ GRPO (MultiWOZ)65.2----\nrather than producing new labels as instructed by the input prompts. It suggested that the SFT model\nprimarily learned a straightforward mapping from user queries to intent labels. In contrast, models\ntrained with GRPO demonstrate significant improvements across all three test sets, maintaining\nover 90% accuracy on both the Unseen5 and Grouped tests. These results indicate that the GRPO\nmodel effectively learns instruction understanding and reasoning, leading to superior generalization\ncapabilities.\nIn order to further validate the above findings, we conduct additional generalization testing on the\nMultiWoz 2.2 dataset. Specifically, we entirely exclude the data corresponding to a particular intent\nfrom the training set and then evaluate the model on the official test set, which includes both the\nunseen category and other categories. As illustrated in Table 2, models trained with GRPO surpass\nthose trained with SFT by over 20% in most categories, except on the \"Attraction\" category where\nboth methods yield subpar performance. These findings underscore that GRPO training improves the\ngeneralization capability for intent detection tasks.\nInterestingly, when excluding an intent categories, models trained with GRPO demonstrated stronger\nin-domain performance than those fine-tuned through SFT - a finding that contrasts with the primary\nresults shown in Table 1.  This divergence suggests that SFT models exhibit greater sensitivity to\nreductions in training data diversity and sample size, while GRPO-trained models maintain more\nconsistent robustness.  Specifically, category removal leads to performance declines of 5%-17%\nin SFT models, whereas GRPO models maintain stable performance, with accuracy reductions\nremaining consistently below 2% in most cases.\nTo further validate the generalization capabilities of the GRPO method, we design and execute\na rigorous cross-domain experiment, as summarized in Table 3.  Specifically, we train a model\nexclusively on the MultiWOZ dataset and subsequently evaluate its zero-shot performance on the\nTODAssistant corpus. Notably, TODAssistant presents a distinct challenge as an artificially generated\nChinese  dialogue  dataset,  differing  fundamentally  from  MultiWOZ  in  both  linguistic  structure\n(Chinese vs.  English) and data provenance (machine-generated vs.  human-curated).  The results\ndemonstrate that the GRPO approach maintains robustness even in such challenging cross-lingual\nand cross-task scenarios, thereby highlighting its superiority over models trained by SFT method.\nIn conclusion, our comprehensive comparative analysis across diverse test sets demonstrates that\nthe GRPO approach (similar to R1) consistently maintains robust generalization capabilities. While\nSFT achieves competitive performance on in-domain evaluations, this method exhibits significant\nlimitations in practical task-oriented dialogue scenarios,  particularly when faced with dynamic\nadjustments to the intent schema or novel domain adaptations.\n4.2    Results of Reward-based Curriculum Sampling\n4.2.1    Results of Curriculum Method\nTo better understand the impact of our proposed Reward-based Curriculum Sampling (RCS) method,\nwe conduct a comparative analysis against both the SFT method and the original GRPO approach,\nwith results presented in Table 4.  The first stage of our RCS method requires only 60 training\nsteps‚Äîsignificantly fewer than the 150 steps needed for the original GRPO method‚Äîyet achieves\ncomparable performance outcomes. We therefore deliberately terminate the first stage of training at\n60 steps to transition to the subsequent curriculum-based phase. Notably, our proposed methodology\nenables the original GRPO to exceed SFT performance during the second training stage. What is\nparticularly significant is that throughout all training phases, RCS utilizes merely 60% of the complete\ntraining dataset compared to the full dataset employed by both SFT and GRPO methods, while still\n7\n\nTable 4: Results of our proposed RCS method on the MultiWOZ dataset.\nModelAttractionHotelRestaurantTaxiTrainAvg\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct\n+ SFT92.693.593.495.692.393.3\n+ GRPO94.591.691.993.992.693.3\n+ GRPO + RCS (First Stage)94.691.992.396.191.792.6\n+ GRPO + RCS (Second Stage)96.294.894.795.794.696.0\n02468101214\nNumber\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\nRewards\n0.02\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.01\n0.10\n0.010.01\n0.01\n0.01\n0.03\n0.79\nGRPO Training Rewards\n02468101214\nNumber\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\nRewards\n0.03\n0.01\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.12\n0.01\n0.01\n0.04\n0.01\n0.02\n0.73\nRCS First Stage Training Rewards\n02468101214\nNumber\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\nRewards\n0.00\n0.000.000.000.00\n0.00\n0.00\n0.14\n0.01\n0.00\n0.01\n0.00\n0.01\n0.83\nRCS Second Stage Training Rewards\nFigure 2: Histogram of rewards during the training process.\ndelivering superior performance.  These findings suggest that easier examples within the GRPO\ntraining framework introduce redundancy, potentially hindering the model‚Äôs ability to concentrate on\nerror-prone and more challenging cases. Our RCS method effectively addresses this limitation by\nprioritizing more informative training instances.\nTo facilitate a clearer analysis of the RCS method, we present the distribution of rewards across all\ntraining data for different methods throughout the training process in Figure 2. For each data point,\nwe design two reward metrics and sampled seven instances, yielding a maximum possible score\nof 14 points per data point in the graph.  The results reveal that, compared to the original GRPO\nmethod, the RCS-based GRPO training strategy increases the proportion of perfect-score examples\nduring the second stage, even when processing more challenging data. These experimental findings\ndemonstrate that theReward-based Curriculum Sampling Strategy enables the model to focus\nmore effectively on challenging examples, thereby enhancing overall model performance.\n4.2.2    Result of Positive Instance Sampling\nDue to the fact that the second stage of Curriculum Learning exclusively comprises erroneous data\nencountered, the initial accuracy of the second stage is considerably low, showing a substantial\ndeviation from the foundation model of the first stage. This deviation may lead to a risk of model\ndegradation. Therefore, we randomly sample data from the whole training set aspositive instanceto\ncombine with the curriculum samples in order to evaluate the performance.\nTable 5 presents a comprehensive comparison of different ratios between positive and challenging\nsamples in our curriculum. We first evaluate the effectiveness of training exclusively with challenging\nexamples, addressing concerns about potential catastrophic forgetting.  Contrary to conventional\nbeliefs,  our results reveal thatexclusive training with challenging data does not lead to the\nexpected performance degradation issues.  Furthermore, we systematically vary the proportion\nof positive examples in the training mixture, observing a clear inverse relationship between the\npercentage of positive examples and the overall performance of the model.  This finding strongly\nsuggests thatthe relative concentration of challenging data in the second training phase critically\ndetermines the model‚Äôs capacity to address difficult cases. The curriculum‚Äôs effectiveness appears\nto depend not only on the inclusion of challenging samples but on ensuring that they constitute a\nsubstantial proportion of the training distribution, allowing sufficient learning signal for the model to\nimprove on precisely those examples where performance gains are most valuable.\n8\n\nTable 5: Results on different ratios between challenging data and positive data during the sampling\nprocess.\nModelAttractionHotelRestaurantTaxiTrainAvg\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct + GRPO + RCS (1:2)97.094.694.096.194.194.8\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct + GRPO + RCS (1:1)96.294.894.795.794.695.0\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct + GRPO + RCS (2:1)96.795.395.096.894.695.4\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct + GRPO + RCS (1:0)98.294.996.498.694.496.0\nTable 6: Ablation results on the \"Thought\" during the GRPO training process.\nModel\nTODAssistant\nMultiWOZ2.2Avg\nin-domainUnseen5SubdividedGrouped\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct + GRPO\nw/o think97.886.472.794.476.185.5\nw/ think96.890.683.193.693.391.5\n4.3    Evaluating the Effect of \"Thought\"\nConsidering that intent detection is inherently simpler than tasks like math or coding, we investigate\nwhether incorporating thought processes during reinforcement learning (which we term \"Thought\"),\nsimilar to the R1 training methodology, is truly necessary. To explore this question, we remove the\n\"Thought\"-related format loss and instructions from our reinforcement learning process and observe\nthe resulting performance changes. We conduct experiments on both datasets.\nThe results in Table 6 demonstrate that on the TODAssistant dataset, models without thought processes\nperformed better on in-distribution tests, with results more closely matching those achieved after\nSFT. However, these models exhibit significantly reduced generalizability.  However, compared\nto pre-trained models and SFT-trained models, their generalization ability still shows substantial\nimprovement,indicating that the reinforcement learning methodology itself provides inherent\nbenefits to model generalization beyond what SFT can achieve.\nFor the MultiWOZ dataset, we observe markedly different results that the performance declining con-\nsiderably as thought processes are removed. We attribute this difference to the inherent characteristics\nof the two datasets: TODAssistant contains machine-synthesized data, resulting in statistically similar\ndistributions between the training and testing sets. In contrast, MultiWOZ is a human-constructed\ndataset specifically designed to evaluate task-oriented dialogue capabilities, demanding a stronger\nunderstanding of known intents and better generalization to varied expressions.\nOur analysis of model output lengths provides additional evidence for this disparity of difficulty:\nmodels trained on TODAssistant data generate responses averaging 37 tokens in length,  while\nMultiWOZ-trained models produce significantly longer outputs, averaging 56 tokens. This quantita-\ntive difference further confirms the variation in task complexity between the datasets. Consequently,\nthe thought process appears more beneficial for MultiWOZ (i.e., more challenging intent detec-\ntion tasks) as it helps models learn recognition logic under reinforcement learning guidance.\n4.4    Base Model or Instruction Model\nSince intent detection requires models to have strong task comprehension and classification capabili-\nties, it shares many similarities with function call tasks. Given that instruct models undergo extensive\nalignment training to better understand and differentiate tools, we are curious whether these models,\nwhich demonstrate significant performance improvements on function call tasks compared to base\nmodels, will also show superior results on intent detection tasks after RL training. Surprisingly, our\nfindings align with observations from mathematical tasks:the base model achieved performance\ncomparable to the instruct model on the intent detection task, as shown in Table 7. We present\na comparison of rewards and completion lengths during the training process for both models in\nFigure 3a and 3b. Notably, while the base model converges more slowly, it ultimately achieves com-\nparably strong performance. This discovery seems to confirm that model capabilities are primarily\n9\n\nTable 7:  Results of the base model and the instruct model trained with GRPO on the MultiWOZ\ndataset.\nModelAttractionHotelRestaurantTaxiTrainAvg\nQwen2.5-7B + GRPO94.9888.9892.0993.9192.0991.93\nQwen2.5-7B-Instruct + GRPO94.4691.5591.9493.9192.5593.25\n020406080100120140160\nTraining Steps\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nRewards\nAccuracy Rewards\n020406080100120140160\nTraining Steps\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nRewards\nFormat Rewards\n020406080100120140160\nTraining Steps\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n700\n800\nRewards\nCompletion Length\n(a) Training states of the base model.\n020406080100120140160\nTraining Steps\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\nRewards\nAccuracy Rewards\n020406080100120140160\nTraining Steps\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nRewards\nFormat Rewards\n020406080100120140160\nTraining Steps\n40\n60\n80\n100\nRewards\nCompletion Length\n(b) Training states of the instruct model.\nFigure 3: Training curves including the accuracy, format reward, and completion length for various\nmodels.\nacquired during pre-training, with subsequent training merely helping models better utilize their\ninherent abilities.\nTo further investigate the completion lengths of the models and determine whether \"aha moments\"\nexist in this task, we reduce the learning rate and increase the training epochs for both models.\nAdditionally, we implement two types of format rewards:  1) A strict format that rigidly restricts\nthe output to the prescribed content, prohibiting any superfluous information; 2) A relaxed format,\nwhere the output is deemed correct as long as it encompasses the specified content.  As shown in\nFigure 4a and 4b, the completion length of the instruct model remains constant under both reward\nfunctions. However, the base model displays an initial decrease followed by an increase in completion\nlength under the relaxed format reward. This phenomenon is absent under the stricter format reward.\nImportantly, the increased length does not contribute valuable information but rather introduces\ntask-irrelevant content.This comparison reveals that R1-like reinforcement learning training\nindeed attempts to increase the length to achieve higher rewards, but true \"aha moments\"\nare less likely to emerge in relatively simple intent detection (single-task setting) tasks, as the\ncontextual logic is limited and does not require deep reasoning from the model.\n050100150200250300\nTraining Steps\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nCompletion Length\nRelaxed Format Reward\n050100150200250300\nTraining Steps\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nCompletion Length\nStrict Format Reward\n(a) Lengths curves of the base model.\n050100150200250300\nTraining Steps\n40\n60\n80\n100\nCompletion Length\nRelaxed Format Reward\n050100150200250300\nTraining Steps\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\nCompletion Length\nStrict Format Reward\n(b) Lengths curves of the instruct model.\nFigure 4: Comparison of completion lengths for various models with different format rewards.\n5    Parameter Tuning Tricks\nIn this section, we will discuss our experimental trials with various parameters in the MultiWOZ\ndataset. As illustrated in Figure 5, we conduct experiments with different learning rates. The results\nindicate that the performance of the model first increases and then decreases as the learning rate\nincreases, achieving optimal performance at a learning rate of9√ó10\n‚àí6\n.  To investigate whether\nthe low learning rates contributed to the non-convergence of the model, we extend the training for\nan additional epoch. We observe that increasing the epochs does not improve performance, which\ndemonstrates that one epoch is sufficient for convergence on the intent detection task.\n10\n\n4e-79e-74e-69e-64e-5\nLearning Rate\n86\n88\n90\n92\n94\nAccuracy\n1 epoch2 epoch\nFigure 5: Figure of the accuracy variation with different parameters.\n6    Conclusion\nIn this work, to enhance the model‚Äôs ability to adapt to complex and dynamic scenarios, we apply\nreinforcement learning to the intent detection task using the GRPO method. We introduce a Reward-\nbased Curriculum Sampling (RCS) method, which leverages the reward function of the GRPO method\nduring the training process to select data of varying difficulty levels.  We conduct the curriculum\nlearning approach and sample more challenging data in the second phase. In this way, the model is\nable to continuously focus on data it does not yet understand, thereby improving its performance and\noutperforming the SFT method. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that the RL-based model\nexhibits superior generalization capabilities on both in-domain and out-of-domain data. Moreover,\nwe also disclose some interesting findings and share insights regarding parameter tuning encountered\nduring our experimental process.\n7    Next Step\nMoving forward, we intend to channel our research efforts into the following areas:\n1) At present, the Reward-based Curriculum Sampling (RCS) we employ is offline. In the future, we\nplan to transition to an online RCS, which will allow for more efficient selection of superior samples.\n2) We aspire to shift our focus from single-intent detection tasks to addressing multi-intent detection\ntasks, which will significantly improve our capacity to deal with the intricacies of dialogue tasks\nfound in real-world situations.\n3) In addition to intent detection tasks, we are set to explore the utilization of reinforcement learning\nwithin other facets of Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems, including but not limited to Dialogue\nPolicy and Response Generation.\n4) We are committed to further investigating the deep-seated reasons behind the \"aha moment\"\nphenomenon, to augment the task-oriented dialogue model‚Äôs abilities in self-reflection, self-correction,\nand self-direction.\nReferences\n[1]Aman Gupta, Anirudh Ravichandran, Ziji Zhang, Swair Shah, Anurag Beniwal, and Narayanan\nSadagopan.

This implementation includes:\n\n## Core Components\n\n1. **Intent Specification Tracker (intentSpecificationTracker.js)**\n   - Records developer intentions rather than just code changes\n   - Detects semantic conflicts between intents\n   - Links commits, prompts, and tests to intents\n   - Maps code elements to their associated intents\n   - Provides import/export of intent history\n\n2. **Enhanced Semantic Conflict Service (semanticConflictServiceEnhanced.js)**\n   - Uses concept graphs to understand semantic relationships\n   - Detects conflicts based on meaning rather than text overlap\n   - Supports both direct and ambiguous conflict detection\n   - Provides conflict resolution strategies\n\n3. **Semantic Commit Panel UI (SemanticCommitPanel.jsx)**\n   - Allows users to create and manage intent specifications\n   - Visualizes conflicts and supports resolution workflows\n   - Records commits linked to intents\n   - Provides code-to-intent mapping visualization\n\n4. **Testing and Demonstration Tools**\n   - JavaScript test script (test-intent-tracker.js)\n   - Standalone HTML demo page (intent-tracker-test.html)\n   - Integration with the main application\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Intent-Based Development**: Focus on why changes are made, not just what changed\n- **Semantic Conflict Detection**: Identify conflicts based on meaning and purpose\n- **Test-Driven Validation**: Verify outcomes through tests rather than line changes\n- **Prompt + Test Bundling**: Store inputs that generated code alongside their validation tests\n\n## How This Addresses the Original Problem\n\nThis implementation directly addresses the points raised in the original request:\n\n1. **Shifting Mental Model**: From tracking line-by-line changes to tracking developer intentions\n2. **AI-Generated Code**: Better suited for large AI-written code changes where intent matters more than specific implementation\n3. **Behavior Verification**: Focuses on whether changes pass tests rather than precisely how code was modified\n4. **Upstream Source Tracking**: Stores prompts, specifications and intent as the versionable units\n\nThe implemented solution provides a concrete alternative to traditional Git for AI-driven development workflows, focusing on what truly matters in this new paradigm: the developer's intent and whether the resulting code behaves as expected.\n\n## Future Potential Enhancements\n\n1. Full integration with testing frameworks\n2. Advanced visualization of intent relationships\n3. AI-assisted intent specification writing\n4. Better integration with traditional version control systems\n\nThis implementation serves as a foundation for a more intuitive and meaningful version control paradigm in the age of AI-driven software development.\n</result>\n</attempt_completion>"}]}]
