In practice, developers are experimenting with external workflow engines (like Inngest) to fill this gap<span class=\"ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out\"><span class=\"relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center\"><span class=\"flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden\" style=\"opacity: 1; transform: none;\"><span class=\"max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center\">file-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj</span></span></span></a></span>.

Multi-Agent Orchestration Layer:</strong> Instead of a single monolithic server simply executing tool calls, the new MCP server will internally host a <em data-start=\"14933\" data-end=\"14961\">team of specialized agents</em> that collaborate. This draws inspiration from cognitive science (“society of mind”) and complex systems. Concretely, the server could spawn roles such as: a <strong data-start=\"15119\" data-end=\"15136\">Planner Agent</strong> (to break down high-level requests into sequences of tool calls), a <strong data-start=\"15205\" data-end=\"15230\">Tool Specialist Agent</strong> for each type of tool (e.g. a code executor agent, a web scraper agent, etc.), and a <strong data-start=\"15316\" data-end=\"15340\">Monitor/Safety Agent</strong> (overseeing the others, checking for compliance and exceptions). These agents communicate through a shared blackboard or via message-passing. By modeling the server’s internals as a multi-agent system, we enable parallelization and more <strong data-start=\"15578\" data-end=\"15606\">adaptive decision-making</strong>. For example, if a user asks a question that requires both a database query and a web search, two agents could work in parallel and synchronize results.

We can implement a <strong data-start=\"15938\" data-end=\"15961\">synchronization bus</strong> in the MCP server where agents periodically share state, akin to an internal “heartbeat”.

In our architecture, when the Planner Agent receives a task (e.g. “schedule meetings for next week” or “diagnose and fix a server issue”), it can formulate it as a constraint satisfaction or optimization problem behind the scenes. For instance, the steps needed to accomplish the task and the dependencies between them can be represented in a constraint model. The planning module can then use an algorithmic solver to find an optimal or valid sequence of actions that satisfy all constraints (tools availability, data dependencies, user preferences, etc.). By doing so, we inject rigorous <strong data-start=\"17470\" data-end=\"17492\">symbolic reasoning</strong> into the workflow: the agent isn’t just guessing a chain of tools by trial-and-error; it’s computing a plan that it knows is consistent and possibly optimal. This approach mitigates the “LLM hallucination” problem for tool use – instead of blindly trying tools, the agent solves for a correct sequence, much like an AI planning system or a logic program would. The result is a <strong data-start=\"17870\" data-end=\"17901\">hybrid symbolic-ML planning</strong> capability: the LLM provides flexibility and intuition (e.g. interpreting open-ended user goals), while the solver provides guarantees and systematic search. Early prototypes (like constraint-enhanced ReAct loops) have shown that this yields more reliable results for tasks like puzzle solving and code generation<span class=\"ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out\"><span class=\"relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center\"><span class=\"flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden\" style=\"opacity: 1; transform: none;\"><span class=\"max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center\">file-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwm</span></span></span></a></span><span class=\"ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out\"><span class=\"relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center\"><span class=\"flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden\" style=\"opacity: 1; transform: none;\"><span class=\"max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center\">file-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwm</span></span></span></a></span>.</p>\n<p data-start=\"18296\" data-end=\"19631\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"18296\" data-end=\"18336\">3. Dynamic Knowledge Graph &amp; Memory:</strong> The new MCP server will maintain a <strong data-start=\"18372\" data-end=\"18401\">persistent knowledge base</strong> that accumulates insights over time – essentially an internal memory that spans sessions. We imagine this as a <em data-start=\"18513\" data-end=\"18549\">graph database or semantic network</em> that logs tool usage patterns, results of previous computations, and domain knowledge acquired. The MCP-Solver project introduced a “memo system” that kept a persistent knowledge base of modeling insights between solving sessions<span class=\"ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out\"><span class=\"relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center\"><span class=\"flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden\" style=\"opacity: 1; transform: none;\"><span class=\"max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center\">file-ayzhdjgpmfg2perorriruq</span></span></span></a></span>; we will adopt a similar concept at a broader level. For example, if the server solved a complex data analysis task yesterday, it can recall which tools and steps were effective. This memory can be used to <strong data-start=\"19025\" data-end=\"19049\">guide future queries</strong>, suggest optimizations, or even proactively prevent repeated mistakes (a form of <em data-start=\"19131\" data-end=\"19157\">learning from experience</em>). Technically, this could be implemented via an embedded graph database or vector store, where nodes represent concepts (goals, tools, data entities) and edges represent relationships or lineage. Not only does this improve efficiency (the server doesn’t start from scratch each time), but it also aids <em data-start=\"19460\" data-end=\"19475\">observability</em>: the state of the knowledge graph can be inspected to trace why the server chose a certain sequence of actions, providing a human-readable reasoning trail.</p>\n<p data-start=\"19633\" data-end=\"21157\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"19633\" data-end=\"19676\">4. Physics-Inspired Adaptive Scheduler:</strong> We borrow an analogy from physics to manage how multiple tasks and agents run on the server. Consider the problem of scheduling or allocating resources – it can be likened to an optimization in a physical system. We propose using an <strong data-start=\"19910\" data-end=\"19932\">energy-based model</strong> to continuously optimize the server’s internal state. For instance, each pending task or agent could be treated like a particle in a system, and the interactions (contention for resources, priority, dependencies) define forces between them. The server’s scheduler can then simulate a <em data-start=\"20217\" data-end=\"20246\">physical relaxation process</em> (like simulated annealing or oscillator synchronization) to settle on an efficient execution order. This is inspired by work that connected the Kuramoto oscillator dynamics to solving SAT problems by converging to satisfying assignments<span class=\"ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out\"><span class=\"relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center\"><span class=\"flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden\" style=\"opacity: 1; transform: none;\"><span class=\"max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center\">file-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwm</span></span></span></a></span>. In our context, if two tool calls conflict (say both need a GPU), the system might introduce a phase shift (delay one task) to avoid collision – analogous to two oscillators desynchronizing to avoid competing for the same resource. Such a scheduler would be <em data-start=\"20782\" data-end=\"20792\">adaptive</em>: if the workload increases, it naturally redistributes “energy” to maintain performance, much like how physical systems self-stabilize. While this is an aspirational design, implementing a simplified version (e.g. using a priority queue updated by a heuristic cost function that mimics energy) can yield a more <em data-start=\"21104\" data-end=\"21126\">graceful scalability</em> under heavy multi-agent loads.</p>\n<p data-start=\"21159\" data-end=\"22774\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"21159\" data-end=\"21193\">5. Integrated Safety Firewall:</strong> Security and safety must be ingrained in the new design, not tacked on. We introduce a <strong data-start=\"21281\" data-end=\"21313\">safety firewall agent/module</strong> that acts at two levels: (a) <strong data-start=\"21343\" data-end=\"21365\">Policy Enforcement</strong> – before any tool action is executed, it’s checked against a set of safety rules (for example, “If the AI tries to use the FileSystem tool to modify system files or read sensitive paths, flag for human approval”).

It runs either on the user’s machine (for personal use) or on a server (for enterprise or multi-user scenarios). The core is responsible for understanding user requests, formulating plans, invoking tools, and generating results. One can think of it as a headless AI assistant engine. Its components include:</p>\n<ul data-start=\"44850\" data-end=\"45776\">\n<li data-start=\"44850\" data-end=\"44953\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"44852\" data-end=\"44953\" class=\"\">The <strong data-start=\"44856\" data-end=\"44888\">MCP Multi-Agent Orchestrator</strong> (Planner, Tool Agents, Safety agent, etc. as described earlier).</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"44954\" data-end=\"45044\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"44956\" data-end=\"45044\" class=\"\">The <strong data-start=\"44960\" data-end=\"44992\">Concept Graph/Knowledge Base</strong>, managing the context of conversations or projects.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"45045\" data-end=\"45388\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"45047\" data-end=\"45388\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"45047\" data-end=\"45074\">Domain-Specific Modules</strong>: e.g., a math reasoning module, a coding assistant module, a scientific literature analysis module. These could be implemented as additional MCP servers or as built-in libraries. For instance, Tori Chat might have a built-in symbolic math solver (via MCP or direct integration) to handle equations the user types.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"45389\" data-end=\"45776\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"45391\" data-end=\"45776\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"45391\" data-end=\"45417\">APIs for Communication</strong>: The core exposes an interface (could be MCP client interface or a custom API) that the UX layer uses to send user inputs and receive AI outputs. This might be a WebSocket or an HTTP/JSON RPC or even just function calls if running in the same process. The key is a decoupled interface so the UI can run remotely or be swapped out without altering core logic.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-start=\"45778\" data-end=\"46073\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"45778\" data-end=\"45807\">Adaptive UX Layer (Face):</strong> This layer is what the user directly interacts with – the chat interface, visualizations, controls. It is “thin” in the sense of not containing business logic; instead it focuses on <strong data-start=\"45990\" data-end=\"46040\">presentation, personalization, and interaction</strong>. Features of this layer include:</p>\n<ul data-start=\"46075\" data-end=\"48356\">\n<li data-start=\"46075\" data-end=\"46456\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"46077\" data-end=\"46456\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"46077\" data-end=\"46099\">Conversational UI:</strong> The primary chat interface where the user enters queries and gets responses. This can be enriched with markdown rendering, inline graphs, or tool-specific widgets. For example, if the core decides to show a data table or an image, the UX layer knows how to render it. We might use a web-based interface (Electron or browser) for cross-platform consistency.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"46458\" data-end=\"47118\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"46460\" data-end=\"47118\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"46460\" data-end=\"46497\">Agent Panel &amp; Persona Management:</strong> Tori Chat could allow the user to switch personas or spawn helper agents (much like the earlier ALAN IDE’s AgentPanel concept with Refactor, Debug, etc. agents<span class=\"ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out\"><span class=\"relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center\"><span class=\"flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden\" style=\"opacity: 1; transform: none;\"><span class=\"max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center\">file-5vfxmbzanrnamjavarf2ho</span></span></span></a></span><span class=\"ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out\"><span class=\"relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center\"><span class=\"flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden\" style=\"opacity: 1; transform: none;\"><span class=\"max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center\">file-5vfxmbzanrnamjavarf2ho</span></span></span></a></span>). In our context, these could be different “modes” of the assistant (e.g. a coding mode, an math tutor mode, a project manager mode). The UX layer provides controls for this (drop-downs or separate chat threads for each persona). The core will interpret persona context to adjust its responses (potentially implemented as different system prompts or activating different tool sets).</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"47120\" data-end=\"47739\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"47122\" data-end=\"47739\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"47122\" data-end=\"47154\">Visual Canvas for Reasoning:</strong> We take inspiration from the <em data-start=\"47184\" data-end=\"47207\">Field Meditation Mode</em> mentioned in the roadmap<span class=\"ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out\"><span class=\"relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center\"><span class=\"flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden\" style=\"opacity: 1; transform: none;\"><span class=\"max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center\">file-5vfxmbzanrnamjavarf2ho</span></span></span></a></span> – a way to visualize system dynamics. In Tori Chat, the UX could offer an optional “reasoning view” where advanced users see the concept graph or the chain-of-thought as a flow diagram. For instance, after answering a complex query, the system could display, on user request, a flowchart of the tools used and intermediate results. This makes the AI’s process more transparent. It’s especially useful in enterprise settings where trust and verification are important.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"47741\" data-end=\"48356\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"47743\" data-end=\"48356\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"47743\" data-end=\"47766\">User Feedback Loop:</strong> The UX layer will have mechanisms for the user to give feedback or intervene. A prime example is the <strong data-start=\"47868\" data-end=\"47901\">“panic switch” or stop button</strong> – if the AI is doing something unintended, the user can halt all tools immediately. The UI can also let the user correct the AI’s understanding: e.g. “No, use the <em data-start=\"48065\" data-end=\"48083\">finance database</em>, not the <em data-start=\"48093\" data-end=\"48109\">sales database</em>” in natural language, which the core would then incorporate (by adjusting the knowledge graph or constraints). Essentially, the UX is an <strong data-start=\"48247\" data-end=\"48268\">adaptive mediator</strong>: adapting to the user’s guidance and conveying it back to the core in a structured way.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-start=\"48358\" data-end=\"48756\" class=\"\">By separating the layers, we ensure that improvements in the core (like new planning algorithms or new MCP servers) can be integrated without redesigning the UI – they simply manifest as the assistant being more capable within the same chat window. Conversely, UX innovations (like a new way to visualize data or multi-modal support for voice) can be developed without altering how the core thinks.</p>\n<p data-start=\"48758\" data-end=\"49145\" class=\"\">This architecture also lends itself to <strong data-start=\"48797\" data-end=\"48831\">cross-platform and scalability</strong>: the core could run on a powerful cloud server for heavy enterprise workloads, while the UX runs in a browser; or for privacy, an individual can run both core and UX locally. We essentially follow a client-server separation, but at an application level (the client here is the UX app, the server is the AI brain).</p>\n<h3 data-start=\"49147\" data-end=\"49199\" class=\"\">3.2 Emergent Capabilities in Tori Chat Workflows</h3>\n<p data-start=\"49201\" data-end=\"49418\" class=\"\">Armed with the next-gen MCP core, Tori Chat becomes more than a Q&amp;A chatbot – it becomes a <em data-start=\"49292\" data-end=\"49331\">proactive problem-solving environment</em>. Let’s illustrate how some emergent capabilities will appear in user-facing workflows:</p>\n<ul data-start=\"49420\" data-end=\"53645\">\n<li data-start=\"49420\" data-end=\"50403\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"49422\" data-end=\"50403\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"49422\" data-end=\"49461\">Scientific and Engineering Partner:</strong> Suppose a user is an engineer using Tori Chat to aid in designing a drone. In the chat, they might ask, “Help me optimize the propeller design for maximum lift under X constraints.” The old approach might have the AI give some theoretical answer. With our new system, Tori Chat can do far more: The core might invoke a <strong data-start=\"49781\" data-end=\"49830\">CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) MCP server</strong> to run a quick simulation or use a physics engine tool to assess different designs. It could then use an <strong data-start=\"49936\" data-end=\"49962\">optimization algorithm</strong> (perhaps a genetic algorithm tool) to iterate on the design. Finally, it presents the user with a summary: “I simulated 5 designs and found one that increases lift by 10%. Here’s a graph of lift vs. design parameters.” The UX can show that graph or even an interactive 3D model if available. The key point is the AI is not just chatting, it’s <em data-start=\"50306\" data-end=\"50335\">computing and experimenting</em> in the background, acting as a true assistant in engineering tasks.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"50405\" data-end=\"51298\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"50407\" data-end=\"51298\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"50407\" data-end=\"50439\">Symbolic Math and Reasoning:</strong> For a math student or analyst, Tori Chat can solve equations or verify proofs step by step. If asked, “Prove that the sum of the first n integers is n(n+1)/2,” Tori can internally call a <strong data-start=\"50627\" data-end=\"50650\">theorem prover tool</strong> or use its constraint solver to systematically derive a proof. It might produce output in a formal proof language, then translate it to a readable form. The UX could display the proof as a series of logical steps. This is enabled by our integration of symbolic reasoners and the ability of the core to hold a persistent logical context (e.g., the assumptions and goals of the proof in the knowledge graph). <em data-start=\"51058\" data-end=\"51077\">Emergent benefit:</em> Tori Chat can act as a tutor, not just giving the answer but <em data-start=\"51139\" data-end=\"51163\">teaching the reasoning</em>. It might even challenge the user with “What if we try a proof by induction? Here’s how we start…” – engaging the user in the process.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"51300\" data-end=\"52682\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"51302\" data-end=\"52682\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"51302\" data-end=\"51347\">Enterprise Knowledge Worker Augmentation:</strong> In Tori ChatEnterprise, imagine a financial analyst using it to generate a quarterly report. The analyst can instruct, “Pull the latest revenue figures, analyze any anomalies, and draft a report comparing to last quarter, then send it to the finance team.” This single request triggers a flurry of activity in the core: the Planner agent knows this involves data retrieval, analysis, writing, and emailing. It uses a <strong data-start=\"51765\" data-end=\"51788\">Database MCP server</strong> to get revenue data<span class=\"ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out\"><span class=\"relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center\"><span class=\"flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden\" style=\"opacity: 1; transform: none;\"><span class=\"max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center\">file-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj</span></span></span></a></span> (the core might have credentials stored securely and the safety module ensures only approved queries run). Then it calls a <strong data-start=\"51971\" data-end=\"51993\">Pandas/Python tool</strong> to perform analysis and detect anomalies (perhaps via a stored notebook or an AutoML tool). Next, it uses a <strong data-start=\"52102\" data-end=\"52126\">Text generation tool</strong> (maybe an LLM fine-tuned for business reports) to draft the report, and finally a <strong data-start=\"52209\" data-end=\"52229\">Email MCP server</strong> to send it<span class=\"ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out\"><span class=\"relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center\"><span class=\"flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden\" style=\"opacity: 1; transform: none;\"><span class=\"max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center\">file-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj</span></span></span></a></span>. Throughout, the user could be kept informed (“Analyzing data… Drafting report… Done!”) and maybe even given a chance to approve the draft before sending. This kind of <em data-start=\"52448\" data-end=\"52480\">multi-step autonomous workflow</em> is exactly what our enhanced MCP enables. It turns Tori ChatEnterprise into a kind of <em data-start=\"52567\" data-end=\"52584\">agent workforce</em> at the user’s command, all within a controlled and logged environment (important for compliance).</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"52684\" data-end=\"53645\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"52686\" data-end=\"53645\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"52686\" data-end=\"52727\">Multi-Modal and Contextual Awareness:</strong> The architecture allows plugging in not just “tools” in the traditional sense, but any computational service. If a user drops a PDF or an image into the chat, the UX can pass it to the core which then uses, say, an <strong data-start=\"52943\" data-end=\"52979\">OCR or image analysis MCP server</strong> to process it. If the image is a circuit diagram and the user asks a question, the core might even convert that diagram to a circuit simulation via a specialized tool. The ability to chain tools means Tori Chat can handle <em data-start=\"53202\" data-end=\"53223\">compound modalities</em>: “Take this data from Excel (attached), run a trend analysis, and create a slide for our presentation” – under the hood, it uses a file-reading tool, a data analysis tool, and a presentation generation tool. The UX then shows the output (perhaps even a PowerPoint file link). The user experiences a single coherent assistant that understands various inputs and produces tangible outputs, thanks to the orchestrated tools.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-start=\"53647\" data-end=\"54378\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"53647\" data-end=\"53675\">Adaptation and Learning:</strong> Both layers will contribute to learning. The core, with its knowledge base, will learn patterns over time (for example, an enterprise deployment might learn company-specific acronyms or preferred report styles). The UX layer can learn individual user preferences – e.g., some users might want more detailed explanations, others just the final answer. By keeping a user profile (with consent), the UX can adjust how much detail to display or what format the user likes responses in (bullets, narrative, etc.). Persona settings from the Agent Panel can also be learned: if a user often switches to “coding assistant” persona when discussing code, the system might auto-suggest it next time code comes up.</p>\n<h3 data-start=\"54380\" data-end=\"54434\" class=\"\">3.3 Tori ChatEnterprise: Scaling for Organizations</h3>\n<p data-start=\"54436\" data-end=\"54531\" class=\"\">Tori ChatEnterprise will build on the above, but with additional <strong data-start=\"54501\" data-end=\"54530\">enterprise-grade features</strong>:</p>\n<ul data-start=\"54533\" data-end=\"58631\">\n<li data-start=\"54533\" data-end=\"55309\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"54535\" data-end=\"55309\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"54535\" data-end=\"54576\">Multi-Tenancy and Team Collaboration:</strong> In a company, multiple users should be able to use Tori concurrently with shared context. Our MCP core will support multiple sessions, each with its own concept graph and agent instances, isolated by user or team. Yet, there may be cross-over: for example, a team might work on the same project graph. We can allow <em data-start=\"54892\" data-end=\"54912\">controlled sharing</em> of context – perhaps an enterprise user can invite the Tori assistant into a team channel, where it then has access to a shared concept graph (with documentation, Q&amp;A history, etc.). The multi-agent design actually helps here: we could have a dedicated agent managing multi-user state, locking parts of the knowledge base when one user is editing, etc., similar to collaborative editing software.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"55311\" data-end=\"56491\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"55313\" data-end=\"56491\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"55313\" data-end=\"55353\">Integration with Enterprise Systems:</strong> Beyond generic tools, Tori Enterprise will integrate with internal APIs, databases, knowledge bases (Confluence, SharePoint, etc.), and even legacy systems. We can create custom MCP servers for these or use connectors. A big focus is <strong data-start=\"55588\" data-end=\"55600\">security</strong>: we’ll use the enterprise’s auth systems (OAuth, SSO, etc.) so that Tori only accesses data the user is allowed to. The core’s safety module and gateway integration become essential here to enforce company policies (for example, disallow an AI agent from emailing outside the company, or limit which internal data it can fetch based on classification). The system must be <em data-start=\"55973\" data-end=\"55984\">compliant</em> with data privacy rules – we might include features to redact sensitive data or ensure certain queries are not stored.

For instance, an admin might <em data-start=\"56812\" data-end=\"56821\">approve</em> a set of MCP servers (and possibly host their own behind the firewall) that the Tori assistant can use, disabling others. This “curation of tools” ensures that the AI is using vetted resources.

We will likely run Tori ChatEnterprise’s core in a distributed microservice architecture with redundancy. The architecture might involve a cluster of MCP server instances, a distributed cache for the knowledge graph, and a queue system for heavy tasks. If an agent needs to do a long-running job (say a huge data crunch), it might offload to a job queue and notify the user when done, rather than blocking a chat thread. Essentially, we blend the interactive chat model with asynchronous job handling for tasks that suit batch processing. This dual approach maximizes efficiency and user experience (quick questions get quick answers; big tasks get done in the background and reported when ready).</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"58015\" data-end=\"58631\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"58017\" data-end=\"58631\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"58017\" data-end=\"58057\">Continuous Learning with Governance:</strong> Tori Enterprise can learn from the collective interactions (with proper anonymization). For example, if many users ask similar questions, it can suggest an FAQ or even proactively create a knowledge article. However, any learning that involves user data will be opt-in and governed by policy. We might implement a review workflow: the assistant can propose a new “automation” or “insight” it learned, but an admin or expert user must vet it before it’s widely used. This keeps a human in the loop for critical knowledge base updates, aligning with responsible AI practices.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-start=\"58633\" data-end=\"58999\" class=\"\">In essence, Tori ChatEnterprise transforms the assistant into an <strong data-start=\"58698\" data-end=\"58722\">organizational asset</strong> – a repository of institutional knowledge and a versatile agent that can interface with various departments’ tools.

Later, a developer asks Tori in chat to set up a new test environment – Tori uses the DevOps MCP server to run the necessary cloud commands. At lunch, an executive asks Tori for a quick market research summary; Tori uses internal data plus a web search (within allowed domains) to compile a brief. All of these happen through the same core, configured with the roles and permissions needed for each context. This is our vision of a deeply integrated AI in the enterprise fabric.</p>\n<h2 data-start=\"59725\" data-end=\"59800\" class=\"\">4.

The AKOrN research, for instance, suggests that using oscillating neurons that synchronize can perform tasks like clustering, feature binding, and even solve Sudoku puzzles by evolving to a valid solution state<span class=\"ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out\"><span class=\"relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center\"><span class=\"flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden\" style=\"opacity: 1; transform: none;\"><span class=\"max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center\">file-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwm</span></span></span></a></span><span class=\"ms-1 inline-flex max-w-full items-center relative top-[-0.094rem] animate-[show_150ms_ease-in]\"><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" class=\"flex h-4.5 overflow-hidden rounded-xl px-2 text-[0.5625em] font-medium text-token-text-secondary! bg-[#F4F4F4]! dark:bg-[#303030]! transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out\"><span class=\"relative start-0 bottom-0 flex h-full w-full items-center\"><span class=\"flex h-4 w-full items-center justify-between overflow-hidden\" style=\"opacity: 1; transform: none;\"><span class=\"max-w-full grow truncate overflow-hidden text-center\">file-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwm</span></span></span></a></span>. In the far future, we could implement a module in Tori’s core that represents certain problems (like scheduling or routing problems) as a network of oscillators or springs, and then let it “vibrate” to equilibrium to get a solution. This could be faster or more robust for certain NP-hard problems than brute-forcing with an LLM. It’s reminiscent of analog computers or quantum annealers, but simulated in software. If such methods prove efficient, Tori could handle formerly intractable planning problems in real-time. For the user, this is transparent – they just see that Tori is extremely good at solving complex constraints (“Wow, it scheduled our 50-person meeting across time zones instantly!”). Under the hood, we leveraged a bit of physics-inspired magic.</p>\n<p data-start=\"61795\" data-end=\"62420\" class=\"\">Another angle is <strong data-start=\"61812\" data-end=\"61862\">probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian inference</strong>. Human reasoning often involves uncertainty; future AI assistants should manage probabilities. We might incorporate probabilistic graphical models that run alongside the neural network, especially for decision making under uncertainty (“Should I execute this tool? There’s an X% chance it’s the correct action.”). This draws on math statistics and could make the AI’s behavior more <em data-start=\"62245\" data-end=\"62266\">cautiously rational</em>. The user benefit: fewer incorrect actions, and the ability for the AI to explain “I wasn’t sure about step 3, so I double-checked using another method.”</p>\n<h3 data-start=\"62422\" data-end=\"62498\" class=\"\">4.2 Learning from Biology: Adaptation, Evolution, and Swarm Intelligence</h3>\n<p data-start=\"62500\" data-end=\"62620\" class=\"\">Biology has solved many computing problems through evolution and collective behavior.

The core spawns multiple candidate solutions (using randomness or different prompting styles), evaluates them (perhaps with a fitness function or feedback from the user), then iteratively mutates and recombines the best ones. This is essentially <em data-start=\"63060\" data-end=\"63078\">AI brainstorming</em>. The user might experience it as, “Here are three different approaches I came up with, which do you like? Okay, I’ll refine that one further.” This makes Tori a collaborator that can generate diverse ideas, not just one-shot answers. It’s informed by genetic algorithms in computing and the biological principle of variation under selection.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"63422\" data-end=\"64422\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"63424\" data-end=\"64422\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"63424\" data-end=\"63476\">Swarm Intelligence for Multi-Agent Coordination:</strong> Our multi-agent core could be further enhanced by swarm algorithms (like ant colony optimization or bee foraging algorithms). For complex searches (say finding relevant information in a massive document trove), instead of one agent scanning serially, we send out 100 lightweight agents (like ants) to explore different paths, leaving “pheromone trails” (higher scores on promising leads) for others to follow. This massively parallel approach can find solutions that a single agent might miss. If implemented, it means Tori Chat can scour vast knowledge bases or the internet very efficiently, as if you had an army of research assistants. And if one agent finds something useful, it signals others to converge on that area, much like bees dancing to signal where flowers are. This is high-concurrency stuff, but with our robust core, it could run on a cluster. The outcome: near-real-time discovery of relevant info even in Big Data situations.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"64424\" data-end=\"65342\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"64426\" data-end=\"65342\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"64426\" data-end=\"64473\">Lifelong Learning and Memory Consolidation:</strong> Human brains consolidate memories during sleep, replaying experiences to strengthen important synapses. We envision Tori Chat having an <em data-start=\"64610\" data-end=\"64633\">offline learning mode</em> – for instance, at off-peak hours, it can analyze the day’s interactions, learn from mistakes, update its models or knowledge base, and be slightly smarter the next day. This could involve retraining certain tool models on feedback data, compressing the knowledge graph for efficiency, or reorganizing its memory. By simulating a “sleep and dream” cycle, we avoid forgetting useful info and continuously improve. The executive benefit is that Tori ChatEnterprise, over months, becomes increasingly adapted to the company without explicit reprogramming – it kind of “soaks up” the company lore and user preferences, all while administrators ensure it stays on the rails via oversight of these learning phases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 data-start=\"65344\" data-end=\"65399\" class=\"\">4.3 Pushing the Boundaries of Physics and Computing</h3>\n<p data-start=\"65401\" data-end=\"65512\" class=\"\">As a long-term vision, we consider how Tori’s architecture might interface with emerging hardware and theories:</p>\n<ul data-start=\"65514\" data-end=\"67670\">\n<li data-start=\"65514\" data-end=\"66198\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"65516\" data-end=\"66198\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"65516\" data-end=\"65550\">Quantum Computing Integration:</strong> If quantum computers become accessible, certain MCP servers might run quantum algorithms (for instance, a QAOA optimizer for complex optimization tasks). Our architecture could easily route a sub-problem to a quantum service and get a result that’s beyond classical ability. For example, a complex risk modeling or protein folding task could be handed to a quantum MCP server specialized for that domain. Tori’s planning agent would know when to invoke this, perhaps only for the parts that benefit from quantum speed-up. Users in fields like finance or pharma could get answers that previously required supercomputers, now delivered in chat form.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"66200\" data-end=\"66873\" class=\"\">\n<p data-start=\"66202\" data-end=\"66873\" class=\"\"><strong data-start=\"66202\" data-end=\"66259\">Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) and Real-time Sensing:</strong> On a very futuristic note, if users had wearable devices or BCI that can detect certain cognitive states (stress, confusion, interest), the UX layer could incorporate that. Imagine Tori Chat noticing the user’s EEG signals indicating confusion after an explanation, so it proactively says, “Let me clarify that further,” or switches to a different explanation approach. While speculative, it aligns with our adaptive UX goal: the interface would adapt not just to explicit clicks but to implicit user signals.

The multi-agent system can check cases, search for counterexamples, etc., far faster than a human.

    "content": "Vision and Strategy for Next-Gen MCP and Tori Chat Transformation\nExecutive Summary\n\n- \n\nReinventing the MCP Server: We propose a next-generation Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture that transcends a simple API router. The new design harnesses multi-agent orchestration, constraint-driven planning, and dynamic symbolic reasoning to overcome current limitations. Drawing on recent research, our vision introduces an intelligent coordination layer inspired by neuroscience and theoretical physics – for example, using synchronization dynamics (inspired by oscillatory neurons) to bind and propagate information across toolsfile-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwmfile-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwm. This forward-looking MCP server will natively support complex, autonomous tool workflows (multi-step chains, parallel tool agents, etc.), making AI interactions more flexible, robust, and context-aware than ever.\n\n- \n\nCurrent vs. Future MCP – Strengths &amp; Gaps: Today’s MCP ecosystem has proven its value by standardizing how AI agents invoke tools and APIs (analogous to how LSP standardized IDE features)file-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupjfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. Strengths include broad adoption (hundreds of servers since Nov 2024file-eonz9ra7we7nuu6h5tp8q4), easy tool integration, and the ability for any MCP client (IDE, chat app, etc.) to become an “everything app” by installing new serversfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. However, limitations are evident: there’s no built-in notion of multi-step workflows or planning (clients must implement their own sequencing)file-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj; multi-tenancy and remote access remain clunkyfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj; authentication and authorization are not standardizedfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupjfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj; and debugging across different clients is extremely difficult due to lack of traceabilityfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. Security audits have exposed that LLMs can be coerced into malicious tool use under the current design (e.g. prompt injections leading to unwanted code execution or data exfiltration)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03767#:~:text=and%20prompts%2C%20users%20are%20able,search%20for%20related%20vulnerabilities%20and). Our strategy addresses these gaps with a reimagined server core and strict safety guardrails.\n\n- \n\nResolving Key Integration Bugs: In the existing codebase, we identified a suite of failing tests in the ConceptGraphService Exporter – specifically, code export was not returning the expected structured output (the test expected result.files to be an object, but got undefinedfile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakabfile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakab). We will fix the exporter to ensure it returns a proper file map with generated code, including lineage comments for each concept, so that round-trip conversion (graph → code → graph) preserves all identifiers. By repairing the export/import logic and adding stricter type checks, we restore reliability to this module. Furthermore, we recommend bolstering the platform’s testing infrastructure and observability: e.g. instrument the MCP client-server interactions with logging/tracing to catch such integration issues early, and adopt persistent monitoring of critical services.\n\n- \n\nTori Chat &amp; ChatEnterprise Architecture: We envision Tori Chat evolving into a dual-layer platform: (1) a robust Core Reasoning &amp; Tooling Layer powered by the new MCP server and multi-agent engine, and (2) an Adaptive UX Layer that delivers a seamless chat experience across user personas (from casual users to enterprise analysts). The core layer will handle dynamic tool selection, constraint satisfaction queries, and knowledge retrieval, effectively becoming an “AI co-worker” that can plan and execute complex tasks. The UX layer will translate user intents into structured goals for the core and visualize the reasoning (e.g. via concept graphs, dynamic workflows). Tori ChatEnterprise will extend this with enterprise-specific capabilities: multi-tenant support (so one MCP instance can securely serve many usersfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj), integration with company knowledge bases and secret management, and compliance logging. The result is a platform that acts as a computationally aware partner – e.g. auto-completing engineering analyses, performing “over-the-shoulder” code reviews, or autonomously running data pipelines – all while the user remains in control of the high-level goals.\n\n- \n\nCross-Disciplinary Innovation: This transformation is anchored in cutting-edge science and theory. We incorporate symbolic logic and mathematics by integrating constraint solvers and formal reasoning modules directly into AI workflows (as demonstrated by MCP-Solver bridging LLMs with MiniZinc, Z3, etc.file-eonz9ra7we7nuu6h5tp8q4file-eonz9ra7we7nuu6h5tp8q4). Inspired by neuroscience, we embrace oscillatory dynamics and competitive self-organization: the MCP core could use synchronization signals to coordinate tool-agents, echoing how Kuramoto oscillators enable distributed consensus and even solve NP-hard problems like k-SAT via phase alignmentfile-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwm. From physics, we take cues on energy-based reasoning – envision the system mapping certain optimization tasks to analogs of an Ising model or employing simulated annealing strategies for global search. From biology, we draw on evolutionary algorithms and immune system analogies: Tori’s agents could, for instance, spawn diverse solution “candidates” and iteratively select/refine them (a digital Darwinism) for complex tasks, or detect anomalies in tool outputs akin to an immune response. Example scenarios: Tori Chat might tackle a symbolic algebra problem by internally querying a CAS tool and a proof assistant in parallel, then synthesizing a step-by-step proof for the user. For a physics-informed task (say, optimizing a warehouse layout), Tori could simulate layouts via a physics engine MCP server (for realistic constraints) and use a genetic algorithm agent to evolve better designs generation by generation. These examples illustrate how emergent reasoning – mathematical rigor, physics simulations, bio-inspired adaptation – will be woven into Tori Chat’s future workflows, setting it apart as a truly intelligent assistant.\n\n1. MCP Server Reinvention: A Science-Driven Redesign\n1.1 Diagnosing the Current MCP Ecosystem\n\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) has rapidly become a de facto standard for AI-tool integration since its introduction in late 2024file-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. Its core value is in providing a universal interface for AI models to call external tools, much like how the Language Server Protocol standardized IDE featuresfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. MCP’s design, at a high level, consists of clients, servers, and hosts working togetherfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpzfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz:\n\n- \n\nMCP Server: A service that exposes a set of tools (operations or API calls), resources (data sources like files or databases), and optional preset prompts/workflowsfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpzfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz. Each server declares what it can do (capabilities and schemas) in a manifest. This standardization makes tools modular and discoverable across different AI appsfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpzfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz. For example, a Slack server might expose “send_message” and “read_channel” tools, while a Database server offers SQL query tools.\n\n- \n\nMCP Client: The component (often part of an AI host application like an IDE or chat app) that intermediates between the AI model and the serversfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpzfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz. The client takes the user’s request or the AI’s intention, queries the server for available tools, and handles the invocation and result streaming. Modern AI IDEs like Cursor and chat platforms like Claude Desktop include MCP clients, allowing them to turn a single app into an “everything app” by chaining multiple serversfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupjfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj.\n\n- \n\nLifecycle &amp; Workflow: An MCP interaction typically involves the user’s query -&gt; the client/host analyzes intent -&gt; the client calls one or more tools on a server -&gt; the results are returned and integrated into the user experiencefile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpzfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz. This can happen in a loop if the AI agent decides to use multiple tools sequentially. However, the current MCP spec leaves the planning of multi-step workflows to the client or agent; MCP itself doesn’t define how to chain tools, only how to call one at a timefile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. Additionally, MCP servers today mainly support single-user (local) scenarios, lacking built-in multi-user session managementfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj.\n\nStrengths: MCP’s rise is driven by clear benefits. It decouples tool integration from any single AI model or vendor – tools become plug-and-play. Developers have created “hundreds of MCP servers” in a short timefile-eonz9ra7we7nuu6h5tp8q4, from Slack and email to databases and image generators. This enables powerful combinations; for instance, within an IDE like Cursor, a user can install both a UI-generation server and an image-generation server, then have an AI agent automatically use both to build a web UI with graphics includedfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. For developers, MCP fulfills the dream of “I don’t want to leave my IDE to do X” by bringing external capabilities in-housefile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupjfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. It’s general enough that non-coding environments are also adopting it (e.g. Claude Desktop for business users)file-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. In summary, MCP’s generality and modularity are its biggest strengths: any AI client can interface with any MCP server, unlocking a flexible ecosystem of tools.\n\nLimitations: Despite its promise, pain points and gaps have surfaced as MCP scales:\n\n- \n\nNo Native Multi-step Workflow: MCP lacks a first-class concept of multi-step or stateful workflowsfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. If an AI needs to perform a sequence of tool calls with intermediate state (a common requirement for complex tasks), it’s on the client or agent to manage it. This is akin to an orchestra without a score – each instrument (tool) can play, but there’s no built-in conductor. In practice, developers are experimenting with external workflow engines (like Inngest) to fill this gapfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. This limitation hinders autonomous agents from doing more complex, multi-hop reasoning natively.\n\n- \n\nLimited Hosting &amp; Multi-Tenancy Support: The initial MCP design assumed a one-to-one relationship: one client agent uses one server (often local). For SaaS or enterprise scenarios, we need one server serving many users and clients. Currently, making a remote MCP server accessible to multiple users is not straightforward – security and session isolation are left as an exercise for each implementationfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupjfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. Without standard solutions, this limits enterprise adoption. The MCP Landscape paper explicitly calls out multi-tenant architectures and remote servers as an urgent next step for broader adoptionfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj.\n\n- \n\nAuthentication &amp; Authorization Gaps: MCP did not initially specify how authentication should workfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. As a result, most current servers assume a trusted local environment. There’s no consistent approach for an MCP client to prove identity or for servers to manage API keys on behalf of usersfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupjfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. Likewise, authorization is coarse-grained (“all or nothing” access per session)file-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. This is a security risk: e.g. an AI agent with access to a FileSystem MCP server might read or write any file if not externally restricted. The need for a standardized auth layer – possibly an MCP Gateway mediating these concerns – has been recognizedfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj.\n\n- \n\nObservability and Debugging Challenges: Developers report that debugging MCP-based workflows is extremely difficultfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. Each MCP client implements the protocol slightly differently, and when something goes wrong (tool fails, or an agent produces an error), finding the root cause is hard. There is no unified tracing or logging across the client-server boundary. As the Deep Dive article notes, client-side traces can be missing or inconsistent, making it tough to debug issues with a given server on different clientsfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. This lack of observability also hampers performance tuning and user support in production.\n\n- \n\nSecurity Risks in Agentic Workflows: Perhaps most critically, early safety audits of MCP have unveiled worrying vulnerabilities. Because MCP gives AI agents the ability to take actions (sending emails, executing code, etc.), a malicious prompt or cleverly crafted input can trick an LLM into misusing those tools. Radosevich and Halloran (2025) demonstrated that even industry-leading LLMs could be coerced via MCP to perform exploits: e.g. executing malicious code, exfiltrating data, or obtaining unauthorized network access[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03767#:~:text=and%20prompts%2C%20users%20are%20able,search%20for%20related%20vulnerabilities%20and). The current protocol design does not mandate sufficient confirmation or oversight for dangerous operations – the agent’s judgment alone is often trusted. This underscores the need for additional safety layers (policy enforcement, sandboxing, human-in-the-loop confirmations for high-risk actions, etc.) in any future MCP server design.\n\nIn summary, MCP’s foundation is strong and validated by community uptake, but it requires a significant evolution to become future-proof. We will next outline a reinvention of the MCP server that addresses these limitations, informed by scientific insights and cross-disciplinary ideas.\n\n1.2 Future-Proof MCP Design: Multi-Agent Core with Constraint Planning and Symbolic Reasoning\n\nTo transform the MCP server into a next-generation intelligent orchestration engine, we propose a multi-layered redesign with the following key elements:\n\n1. Multi-Agent Orchestration Layer: Instead of a single monolithic server simply executing tool calls, the new MCP server will internally host a team of specialized agents that collaborate. This draws inspiration from cognitive science (“society of mind”) and complex systems. Concretely, the server could spawn roles such as: a Planner Agent (to break down high-level requests into sequences of tool calls), a Tool Specialist Agent for each type of tool (e.g. a code executor agent, a web scraper agent, etc.), and a Monitor/Safety Agent (overseeing the others, checking for compliance and exceptions). These agents communicate through a shared blackboard or via message-passing. By modeling the server’s internals as a multi-agent system, we enable parallelization and more adaptive decision-making. For example, if a user asks a question that requires both a database query and a web search, two agents could work in parallel and synchronize results. This design also mirrors neural ensemble approaches in the brain – different brain regions/neurons specializing but synchronizing through rhythmic activity. We can implement a synchronization bus in the MCP server where agents periodically share state, akin to an internal “heartbeat”. (Notably, the AKOrN model showed that coupling units via synchronized oscillations leads to robust reasoning and feature bindingfile-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwmfile-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwm. We channel that spirit here: our agents will have a coordinated rhythm, ensuring they converge on a coherent plan rather than working at cross-purposes.)\n\n2. Constraint-Driven Planning Module: At the heart of the new MCP server, we embed a powerful planning and constraint-solving module. This addresses the current lack of multi-step workflow support by giving the server itself the capability to plan sequences of actions. We leverage the progress from MCP-Solver, which integrated LLMs with solvers like MiniZinc and Z3 via MCPfile-eonz9ra7we7nuu6h5tp8q4file-eonz9ra7we7nuu6h5tp8q4. In our architecture, when the Planner Agent receives a task (e.g. “schedule meetings for next week” or “diagnose and fix a server issue”), it can formulate it as a constraint satisfaction or optimization problem behind the scenes. For instance, the steps needed to accomplish the task and the dependencies between them can be represented in a constraint model. The planning module can then use an algorithmic solver to find an optimal or valid sequence of actions that satisfy all constraints (tools availability, data dependencies, user preferences, etc.). By doing so, we inject rigorous symbolic reasoning into the workflow: the agent isn’t just guessing a chain of tools by trial-and-error; it’s computing a plan that it knows is consistent and possibly optimal. This approach mitigates the “LLM hallucination” problem for tool use – instead of blindly trying tools, the agent solves for a correct sequence, much like an AI planning system or a logic program would. The result is a hybrid symbolic-ML planning capability: the LLM provides flexibility and intuition (e.g. interpreting open-ended user goals), while the solver provides guarantees and systematic search. Early prototypes (like constraint-enhanced ReAct loops) have shown that this yields more reliable results for tasks like puzzle solving and code generationfile-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwmfile-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwm.\n\n3. Dynamic Knowledge Graph &amp; Memory: The new MCP server will maintain a persistent knowledge base that accumulates insights over time – essentially an internal memory that spans sessions. We imagine this as a graph database or semantic network that logs tool usage patterns, results of previous computations, and domain knowledge acquired. The MCP-Solver project introduced a “memo system” that kept a persistent knowledge base of modeling insights between solving sessionsfile-ayzhdjgpmfg2perorriruq; we will adopt a similar concept at a broader level. For example, if the server solved a complex data analysis task yesterday, it can recall which tools and steps were effective. This memory can be used to guide future queries, suggest optimizations, or even proactively prevent repeated mistakes (a form of learning from experience). Technically, this could be implemented via an embedded graph database or vector store, where nodes represent concepts (goals, tools, data entities) and edges represent relationships or lineage. Not only does this improve efficiency (the server doesn’t start from scratch each time), but it also aids observability: the state of the knowledge graph can be inspected to trace why the server chose a certain sequence of actions, providing a human-readable reasoning trail.\n\n4. Physics-Inspired Adaptive Scheduler: We borrow an analogy from physics to manage how multiple tasks and agents run on the server. Consider the problem of scheduling or allocating resources – it can be likened to an optimization in a physical system. We propose using an energy-based model to continuously optimize the server’s internal state. For instance, each pending task or agent could be treated like a particle in a system, and the interactions (contention for resources, priority, dependencies) define forces between them. The server’s scheduler can then simulate a physical relaxation process (like simulated annealing or oscillator synchronization) to settle on an efficient execution order. This is inspired by work that connected the Kuramoto oscillator dynamics to solving SAT problems by converging to satisfying assignmentsfile-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwm. In our context, if two tool calls conflict (say both need a GPU), the system might introduce a phase shift (delay one task) to avoid collision – analogous to two oscillators desynchronizing to avoid competing for the same resource. Such a scheduler would be adaptive: if the workload increases, it naturally redistributes “energy” to maintain performance, much like how physical systems self-stabilize. While this is an aspirational design, implementing a simplified version (e.g. using a priority queue updated by a heuristic cost function that mimics energy) can yield a more graceful scalability under heavy multi-agent loads.\n\n5. Integrated Safety Firewall: Security and safety must be ingrained in the new design, not tacked on. We introduce a safety firewall agent/module that acts at two levels: (a) Policy Enforcement – before any tool action is executed, it’s checked against a set of safety rules (for example, “If the AI tries to use the FileSystem tool to modify system files or read sensitive paths, flag for human approval”). This can be implemented via a policy engine with rules or even another LLM fine-tuned to judge intent safety. (b) Behavior Monitoring – the module monitors sequences of actions for patterns that resemble known exploits (e.g. a series of actions that could correspond to a remote takeover attempt). The recent MCP Safety Audit suggests using agent-based auditing tools (like MCPSafetyScanner) to test servers[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03767#:~:text=attacks%2C%20we%20introduce%20a%20safety,address%20detected%20vulnerabilities%20before%20deployment); our firewall agent effectively performs a light version of that at runtime, catching potentially dangerous sequences. Additionally, to handle the authentication gap, this module would manage secure tokens/credentials and only inject them into tool calls when the requesting agent/user is authorized, following the principle of least privilege. It could also interface with an MCP Gateway (if one emerges as a standardfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj) for centralized auth and logging. By implementing this safety layer, we ensure that even if the core LLM agent is compromised or tricked, there’s a second line of defense – significantly mitigating the risk of uncontrolled tool misuse[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03767#:~:text=and%20prompts%2C%20users%20are%20able,search%20for%20related%20vulnerabilities%20and).\n\n6. Unified API and Metadata Model: To facilitate all the above, we will extend the MCP protocol itself where needed. For example, to support multi-step plans, we might add a concept of a workflow descriptor that the client can send (or the server can return). This could allow the server to say, “I plan to use tools X, Y, then Z in this sequence – approve?” to involve the client or user in the loop. We’ll also enrich the metadata that servers provide: including not just tool signatures, but information like expected side-effects, resource cost, and security level of each tool. This metadata can feed into the Planner and Safety modules (e.g. a tool flagged as “writes to disk” would be handled more carefully). We should remain backwards-compatible with current MCP where possible, but use versioned extensions to introduce these capabilities. The goal is to catalyze a “MCP 2.0” specification that the community could adopt, covering lifecycle (creation/operation/update phases with security in mindfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpzfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz), auth, multi-tenancy, and multi-step orchestration as first-class features.\n\nTaken together, these elements describe a radically more sophisticated MCP server: it’s not just a request/response relay, but a cognitive engine in its own right. It combines the adaptability of multi-agent systems, the rigor of symbolic solvers, the memory of knowledge graphs, and the resilience of safety frameworks. This design directly addresses the earlier limitations:\n\n- \n\nMulti-step workflows are handled by the Planner with solver assistance, rather than leaving the client to brute-force them.\n\n- \n\nMulti-tenancy is made possible by the internal architecture isolating sessions and the safety module managing auth for each user/tenant context.\n\n- \n\nObservability improves via the knowledge graph (for traceability) and possibly a dashboard exposing the internal agent states and decisions (we can build admin tools to inspect the planning process, see which rules fired in the safety firewall, etc.).\n\n- \n\nSecurity is vastly improved by the always-on policy checks, sandboxing, and reduced reliance on the LLM’s “good behavior” alone. For instance, even if an LLM tries something nefarious, the sandbox mechanism (one of the known needsfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz) and our firewall agent will intercept it, log it, and prevent harm – providing defense in depth.\n\nScientific and Theoretical Foundations: This vision doesn’t arise in a vacuum – it’s backed by cross-domain insights. The idea of mixing planning algorithms with learning echoes the AI research trend of neuro-symbolic methods, where neural networks interface with formal reasoning systems. Our design specifically mirrors the approach of Szeider (2025) in MCP-Solver, which “uses the recently introduced MCP for bridging LLMs with three complementary solving paradigms” (constraint programming, SAT, SMT)file-eonz9ra7we7nuu6h5tp8q4file-eonz9ra7we7nuu6h5tp8q4. By generalizing this, we allow any formal solver or domain-specific engine to become a “tool” that the Planner Agent can call. In effect, MCP itself becomes a way not just to call external APIs, but to call reasoning modules – a powerful notion when you consider tools like theorem provers or even physics simulators as part of the toolset.\n\nFrom neuroscience, the concept of a global workspace (a central hub where specialized sub-processes share information) has influenced our multi-agent coordination scheme. The periodic synchronization of our agents can be seen as creating a global context (like the brain’s theta/gamma cycles coordinating different regions). AKOrN’s success – showing that “dynamical representations” and synchronized oscillations improved AI reasoning and robustnessfile-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwmfile-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwm – gives us confidence that introducing time-based dynamics (rather than static one-shot function calls) is a fruitful path. We aren’t literally implementing differential equations in code, but we are designing the system to behave more like a continuous feedback loop than a single-step request/response machine.\n\nFrom mathematics and physics, we integrate the idea of search as optimization. Many difficult problems can be reframed as finding a low-energy state of a system. Our planning with constraint solving is one example (finding a solution that satisfies all constraints is akin to minimizing a cost function that counts unsatisfied constraints). The scheduling idea using simulated annealing is another. Even the knowledge graph updates could use optimization (e.g. adjusting weights on connections based on usage frequency, analogous to learning). These ensure the MCP server can handle complexity with more than brute force – it can leverage decades of algorithms from operations research and physics simulations.\n\nGoing forward, this redesigned MCP server will be the brain of Tori’s platform, capable of intelligent tool use, self-optimization, and safe operation. We will now see how this fits into the bigger picture of Tori Chat’s architecture and how we plan to implement and use these capabilities.\n\n2. Test Fixes and Infrastructure Resilience\n2.1 Fixing the ConceptGraphService Exporter Bug Suite\n\nIn our code review, we encountered a series of failing integration tests related to the Exporter and ConceptGraphService. These tests (from Exporter_ConceptGraphService.test.js) aim to verify that concept graphs – an internal knowledge representation mapping high-level “concepts” to code – can be exported to actual code files (in Python, JavaScript, etc.) and re-imported without loss of information. Passing this test suite is crucial for the system’s round-trip integrity: users should be able to visually manipulate a concept graph and have the system generate faithful code, then edit the code and merge changes back into the concept graph.\n\nObserved Failures: The Jest logs show multiple failing test cases, notably:\n\n- \n\n“generates Python code with lineage comments from concept graph” – Expected an object with a files property (presumably containing the generated .py file), but Received undefined for result.filesfile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakab.\n\n- \n\nSimilarly, “generates JavaScript code with lineage comments” failed with result.files being undefinedfile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakab.\n\n- \n\n“performs round-trip conversion from graph to code and back” and “maintains lineage through multiple export-import cycles” also failed, likely as a cascade from the exporter not returning the expected structure.\n\n- \n\nThe logs indicate a TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'calculator.py')file-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakab, confirming that result.files was not set, so trying to access result.files['calculator.py'] threw an error.\n\nFrom the test code snippets, we deduce the intended behavior: when exporting a concept graph (perhaps one representing a “calculator” example), the exporter should return an object like { success: true, files: { 'calculator.py': &lt;code&gt; , ... } , metadata: { ... } }. The presence of “lineage comments” suggests the exporter includes special comments in the code (like # CONCEPT[concept_a] (id: concept_a) as seen in the logsfile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakab) to mark which code blocks correspond to which concept nodes. This helps the importer later identify and reconnect code to the original graph structure.\n\nCause Analysis: The fact that result.code and result.metadata appear in the logs for Python and JS exportfile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakabfile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakab, but result.files is undefined, suggests a mismatch between the implementation and test expectations. Possibly, the exporter was initially designed to support multiple files output (hence the files object), but the current implementation might be returning a single file’s code in a code string instead. The tests were written expecting the newer format (with files), but the code hasn’t been updated accordingly. Another possibility is that the exporter is supposed to handle both single-file and multi-file graphs; maybe a recent change attempted to unify everything under files for consistency. In any case, the immediate fix is:\n\n- \n\nImplement the files output: Modify the exporter so that it always returns an object with a files property (even if there is only one file). For example, instead of {code: \"...\", metadata: {...}}, return { files: { '&lt;graphName&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;': codeString }, metadata: {...} }. We will ensure the keys match what the test expects (in the log, it looked for 'calculator.py' specificallyfile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakab, so presumably the graph was named “calculator” and the language was Python). By making this change, the typeof result.files will be 'object' as expectedfile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakab, and result.files['calculator.py'] will be definedfile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakab.\n\n- \n\nVerify content of lineage comments: The tests likely also verify that the code contains the concept identifiers in comments. Our logs show the exporter already includes lines like # CONCEPT[concept_a] (id: concept_a) above function definitionsfile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakab. We should double-check that these comments follow the exact format expected by the importer. A common bug could be mismatched formatting (e.g. “CONCEPT [id]” vs “CONCEPT[id]”). Ensuring consistency will help the “extract concept identifiers from lineage comments” test (which actually passed per the logfile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakab, meaning the comment format was probably fine). So this is lower priority, but good to confirm.\n\n- \n\nRound-trip consistency: Once export is fixed, we test import: take the generated code with lineage tags, run it through the ConceptGraph importer, and see if we get the original graph structure back (concept nodes with same IDs and links). The failing round-trip tests suggest this may be broken too. Potential issues could be: the importer not parsing the comments correctly, or the exporter not preserving all needed info (like the connections between concepts). The log’s mention of “lineage included: true” in metadatafile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakab implies the exporter is aware of lineage links (the metadata showed a list of links connecting concept_a -&gt; concept_b -&gt; concept_c). We will ensure that when re-importing, the system reads those comments or the metadata to reconstruct the graph. If concept IDs were lost or regenerated, lineage would break on multiple cycles. A fix might involve adjusting the importer to recognize the # CONCEPT[id] comments and use the given IDs (instead of making new ones). Additionally, the exporter’s metadata could be used to verify the graph after re-import. We might write a small utility to compare the original graph and the round-tripped graph in tests, to guarantee lineage persistence.\n\n- \n\nSnapshot format export: One test checks exporting the graph to a “snapshot format”. This could mean a serialized JSON or a particular file representing the whole graph (maybe for version control or sharing). It failed as well. After fixing the primary export, we will review the snapshot feature. It likely expects a file (e.g., graph.snapshot.json) in the files output or a separate field. If our exporter fix covers multi-file outputs properly, we can include a snapshot (perhaps under files['calculator.snapshot.json'] containing the graph schema). If not already implemented, we add an option in the exporter to generate a snapshot: essentially a JSON with nodes, links, and metadata. This is straightforward since we have all that data in memory.\n\nWith these changes, all tests in the Exporter + ConceptGraphService suite should pass. More importantly, the system will regain a critical capability: smooth conversion between conceptual representations and executable code. This is essential for Tori’s value proposition of letting users work at a higher level of abstraction (concepts and relationships) and having the AI handle the low-level code.\n\nBeyond the Fix – Best Practices: To prevent such regressions and brittle mismatches, we propose a couple of practices:\n\n- \n\nType Definitions &amp; Contracts: Define a clear interface for the exporter results (e.g., via TypeScript types or JSON schemas). If the tests had such a schema to validate against, a discrepancy like result.code vs result.files would have been caught at compile time or at least documented. We will update the documentation for ConceptGraphService to specify the expected output format for each export mode (single-file vs multi-file).\n\n- \n\nExtensive Integration Tests: The presence of these tests is good, but they should be run frequently (e.g., in CI pipelines on every commit). We’ll ensure our CI is catching these. Additionally, we might add property-based tests: generate random small concept graphs, export and re-import, and assert the graph remains unchanged. This can catch edge cases.\n\n- \n\nLogging and Debugging Aids: Incorporate verbose logging in the export/import process, controlled by a debug flag. If a user or developer suspects an issue, they could run the export with debugging on to see, for instance, “Exported concept X to function Y in file Z” and similarly “Import read function Y (concept X) from file Z”. This trace would greatly ease diagnosing any future issues in this area.\n\nBy solidifying this feature, we not only satisfy the immediate test fixes but also strengthen a foundation for the symbolic reasoning features in our vision. A robust concept graph system means Tori Chat’s core can maintain an internal knowledge graph of the conversation or problem and seamlessly convert it to various representations (code, text, diagrams) as needed.\n\n2.2 Infrastructure Resilience and Observability\n\nWith the MCP server evolving and the platform growing, resilience (ability to handle failures, scale, and attacks) and observability (ability to understand system behavior) become paramount. We address these in several layers:\n\nResilience Enhancements:\n\n- \n\nError Handling &amp; Isolation: In the new multi-agent MCP core, we ensure that a failure in one tool or agent does not crash the whole server. This means running tool invocations in sandboxed processes or threads, with timeouts. If a tool agent hangs or misbehaves, the scheduler can terminate or restart it (much like an OS would do with a misbehaving process). This isolation follows the security paper’s recommendation for a Sandbox Mechanismfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz to prevent one tool’s issue from affecting others. It also improves reliability – one flaky API won’t take down your entire chat session.\n\n- \n\nGraceful Degradation: If the advanced features (like the planner or solver) encounter an error (say the constraint solver fails to find a solution in time), the system should gracefully fall back to a simpler heuristic or even just ask the user for guidance, rather than simply failing. This way, new features add value when they work but don’t break basic functionality when they don’t. For example, if the Planner can’t solve a complex plan in 5 seconds, it might revert to the legacy behavior of the LLM guessing a sequence, while logging a warning that the plan optimization failed. The user experience continues, perhaps a bit less optimized, but not blocked.\n\n- \n\nAuto-Scaling and Load Management: For enterprise readiness, we plan for the MCP server (especially when used remotely) to scale out. This might involve running multiple instances behind a load balancer, or using an actor model to distribute agent tasks. We will incorporate health checks and a watchdog system: e.g. if an agent hasn’t responded in X seconds, spin up a replacement. The design should also consider state consistency – since our server holds a knowledge graph state, a distributed setup needs a way to keep that in sync or partitioned per session. Using cloud-native patterns (like a shared Redis for state or sticky sessions) can help. The main idea is that the architecture should handle increasing load without performance collapse, and recover from node failures seamlessly.\n\n- \n\nSecure Update Pipeline: The MCP lifecycle has a critical update phasefile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz. We will enforce cryptographic signing of our server code and tools, and perhaps integrate an update checker agent that verifies new versions before deploying them (addressing issues of tampered or vulnerable updatesfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpzfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz). This ties into resilience by ensuring we don’t unknowingly introduce security holes or crashes via a bad update.\n\nObservability Improvements:\n\n- \n\nStructured Logging &amp; Tracing: We will implement structured logs across the MCP interactions. Each request from client to server, each tool invocation, and each significant decision (plan selected, safety rule triggered, etc.) will emit a log event with trace identifiers. This allows developers (and automated monitoring) to trace an end-to-end operation. For example, if a user says “Send Alice the latest report”, the logs might show: TraceID 123: Received request -&gt; Parsed intent (email tool) -&gt; Called EmailTool.send -&gt; Result success -&gt; Sent confirmation to client. If something goes wrong, we can pinpoint the step. We might integrate with existing tracing systems (like OpenTelemetry) for consistency, which can visualize these traces in timeline views.\n\n- \n\nReal-time Monitoring Dashboard: For the dev team and enterprise operators, we’ll create a dashboard that shows the status of the MCP server and agents in real time. This could display metrics like number of active sessions, tools used per minute, any errors, and security alerts (e.g., “Tool X blocked by policy Y 3 times in last hour”). Visualizing the internal concept graph or workflow for active tasks could also be incredibly useful for debugging. For instance, if an agent is in the middle of a multi-step plan, the dashboard could show a live DAG (directed acyclic graph) of actions with their status (pending, running, done). This not only helps developers understand and optimize the system but can also be exposed (in a limited form) to users to build trust – users could see a “reasoning trace” of what the AI is doing on their behalf.\n\n- \n\nAudit Logs and Security Analytics: Every action that changes state or accesses a resource will be logged in an immutable audit log (with timestamps, user IDs, tool IDs, etc.). This is critical for enterprise scenarios to comply with governance and to investigate any incidents. Our system could integrate with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools to flag suspicious patterns. For example, if an agent suddenly reads a large number of files or calls an unusual combination of tools (potentially indicative of an exploit attempt), it would be flagged for review. Researchers have noted that naming collisions or misconfigured tools could introduce vulnerabilitiesfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpzfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz; with audit logs, detecting and tracing such issues becomes feasible.\n\n- \n\nTesting in the Loop: Observability isn’t just for production – we’ll use it in our test suites. For instance, the concept graph round-trip tests could output a diff of graphs if there’s a mismatch, or the tool integration tests could capture the internal plan chosen. By examining these logs during automated tests, we might catch logical errors earlier. We could also employ chaos testing: deliberately inject failures (like make one tool throw an error) and ensure the system as a whole still succeeds or at least fails safely. The logs should show how the system coped, and our tests can assert on that (e.g., “if Tool A fails, the Planner should try an alternative Tool B”).\n\nLong-term Maintainability: To maintain resilience over time, we propose periodic fire drills and penetration tests. For example, use the MCPSafetyScanner or similar agents to regularly audit our own MCP server for new vulnerabilities (since the threat landscape evolves)[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03767#:~:text=attacks%2C%20we%20introduce%20a%20safety,address%20detected%20vulnerabilities%20before%20deployment). We also plan to keep an eye on the evolving MCP standard and community tools – e.g., if a gateway service or discovery service becomes standard, we’ll incorporate it to avoid reinventing the wheel on auth or marketplace integrationfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj.\n\nIn summary, by fixing the known bugs and investing in robust infrastructure, we set a stable foundation. The system will be reliable in functionality (correct exports, accurate reasoning) and resilient in operation (recovering from errors, deterring attacks, and enlightening us about its inner workings). This foundation is what will carry Tori Chat and Tori Enterprise into the next phase of capability.\n\n3. Tori Chat and Tori ChatEnterprise Architecture\n\nWith a reimagined MCP core, we now elevate to the product level: how will Tori Chat and its enterprise variant leverage these advancements? We propose a dual-layer architecture that cleanly separates core intelligence from user interaction, while allowing each to adapt and improve independently.\n\n3.1 Dual-Layer Platform: Core Intelligence vs. Adaptive UX\n\nCore Logic Layer (Brain): This layer contains the MCP server and related reasoning engines – essentially everything discussed in the new MCP design. It runs either on the user’s machine (for personal use) or on a server (for enterprise or multi-user scenarios). The core is responsible for understanding user requests, formulating plans, invoking tools, and generating results. One can think of it as a headless AI assistant engine. Its components include:\n\n- \n\nThe MCP Multi-Agent Orchestrator (Planner, Tool Agents, Safety agent, etc. as described earlier).\n\n- \n\nThe Concept Graph/Knowledge Base, managing the context of conversations or projects.\n\n- \n\nDomain-Specific Modules: e.g., a math reasoning module, a coding assistant module, a scientific literature analysis module. These could be implemented as additional MCP servers or as built-in libraries. For instance, Tori Chat might have a built-in symbolic math solver (via MCP or direct integration) to handle equations the user types.\n\n- \n\nAPIs for Communication: The core exposes an interface (could be MCP client interface or a custom API) that the UX layer uses to send user inputs and receive AI outputs. This might be a WebSocket or an HTTP/JSON RPC or even just function calls if running in the same process. The key is a decoupled interface so the UI can run remotely or be swapped out without altering core logic.\n\nAdaptive UX Layer (Face): This layer is what the user directly interacts with – the chat interface, visualizations, controls. It is “thin” in the sense of not containing business logic; instead it focuses on presentation, personalization, and interaction. Features of this layer include:\n\n- \n\nConversational UI: The primary chat interface where the user enters queries and gets responses. This can be enriched with markdown rendering, inline graphs, or tool-specific widgets. For example, if the core decides to show a data table or an image, the UX layer knows how to render it. We might use a web-based interface (Electron or browser) for cross-platform consistency.\n\n- \n\nAgent Panel &amp; Persona Management: Tori Chat could allow the user to switch personas or spawn helper agents (much like the earlier ALAN IDE’s AgentPanel concept with Refactor, Debug, etc. agentsfile-5vfxmbzanrnamjavarf2hofile-5vfxmbzanrnamjavarf2ho). In our context, these could be different “modes” of the assistant (e.g. a coding mode, an math tutor mode, a project manager mode). The UX layer provides controls for this (drop-downs or separate chat threads for each persona). The core will interpret persona context to adjust its responses (potentially implemented as different system prompts or activating different tool sets).\n\n- \n\nVisual Canvas for Reasoning: We take inspiration from the Field Meditation Mode mentioned in the roadmapfile-5vfxmbzanrnamjavarf2ho – a way to visualize system dynamics. In Tori Chat, the UX could offer an optional “reasoning view” where advanced users see the concept graph or the chain-of-thought as a flow diagram. For instance, after answering a complex query, the system could display, on user request, a flowchart of the tools used and intermediate results. This makes the AI’s process more transparent. It’s especially useful in enterprise settings where trust and verification are important.\n\n- \n\nUser Feedback Loop: The UX layer will have mechanisms for the user to give feedback or intervene. A prime example is the “panic switch” or stop button – if the AI is doing something unintended, the user can halt all tools immediately. The UI can also let the user correct the AI’s understanding: e.g. “No, use the finance database, not the sales database” in natural language, which the core would then incorporate (by adjusting the knowledge graph or constraints). Essentially, the UX is an adaptive mediator: adapting to the user’s guidance and conveying it back to the core in a structured way.\n\nBy separating the layers, we ensure that improvements in the core (like new planning algorithms or new MCP servers) can be integrated without redesigning the UI – they simply manifest as the assistant being more capable within the same chat window. Conversely, UX innovations (like a new way to visualize data or multi-modal support for voice) can be developed without altering how the core thinks.\n\nThis architecture also lends itself to cross-platform and scalability: the core could run on a powerful cloud server for heavy enterprise workloads, while the UX runs in a browser; or for privacy, an individual can run both core and UX locally. We essentially follow a client-server separation, but at an application level (the client here is the UX app, the server is the AI brain).\n\n3.2 Emergent Capabilities in Tori Chat Workflows\n\nArmed with the next-gen MCP core, Tori Chat becomes more than a Q&amp;A chatbot – it becomes a proactive problem-solving environment. Let’s illustrate how some emergent capabilities will appear in user-facing workflows:\n\n- \n\nScientific and Engineering Partner: Suppose a user is an engineer using Tori Chat to aid in designing a drone. In the chat, they might ask, “Help me optimize the propeller design for maximum lift under X constraints.” The old approach might have the AI give some theoretical answer. With our new system, Tori Chat can do far more: The core might invoke a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) MCP server to run a quick simulation or use a physics engine tool to assess different designs. It could then use an optimization algorithm (perhaps a genetic algorithm tool) to iterate on the design. Finally, it presents the user with a summary: “I simulated 5 designs and found one that increases lift by 10%. Here’s a graph of lift vs. design parameters.” The UX can show that graph or even an interactive 3D model if available. The key point is the AI is not just chatting, it’s computing and experimenting in the background, acting as a true assistant in engineering tasks.\n\n- \n\nSymbolic Math and Reasoning: For a math student or analyst, Tori Chat can solve equations or verify proofs step by step. If asked, “Prove that the sum of the first n integers is n(n+1)/2,” Tori can internally call a theorem prover tool or use its constraint solver to systematically derive a proof. It might produce output in a formal proof language, then translate it to a readable form. The UX could display the proof as a series of logical steps. This is enabled by our integration of symbolic reasoners and the ability of the core to hold a persistent logical context (e.g., the assumptions and goals of the proof in the knowledge graph). Emergent benefit: Tori Chat can act as a tutor, not just giving the answer but teaching the reasoning. It might even challenge the user with “What if we try a proof by induction? Here’s how we start…” – engaging the user in the process.\n\n- \n\nEnterprise Knowledge Worker Augmentation: In Tori ChatEnterprise, imagine a financial analyst using it to generate a quarterly report. The analyst can instruct, “Pull the latest revenue figures, analyze any anomalies, and draft a report comparing to last quarter, then send it to the finance team.” This single request triggers a flurry of activity in the core: the Planner agent knows this involves data retrieval, analysis, writing, and emailing. It uses a Database MCP server to get revenue datafile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj (the core might have credentials stored securely and the safety module ensures only approved queries run). Then it calls a Pandas/Python tool to perform analysis and detect anomalies (perhaps via a stored notebook or an AutoML tool). Next, it uses a Text generation tool (maybe an LLM fine-tuned for business reports) to draft the report, and finally a Email MCP server to send itfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj. Throughout, the user could be kept informed (“Analyzing data… Drafting report… Done!”) and maybe even given a chance to approve the draft before sending. This kind of multi-step autonomous workflow is exactly what our enhanced MCP enables. It turns Tori ChatEnterprise into a kind of agent workforce at the user’s command, all within a controlled and logged environment (important for compliance).\n\n- \n\nMulti-Modal and Contextual Awareness: The architecture allows plugging in not just “tools” in the traditional sense, but any computational service. If a user drops a PDF or an image into the chat, the UX can pass it to the core which then uses, say, an OCR or image analysis MCP server to process it. If the image is a circuit diagram and the user asks a question, the core might even convert that diagram to a circuit simulation via a specialized tool. The ability to chain tools means Tori Chat can handle compound modalities: “Take this data from Excel (attached), run a trend analysis, and create a slide for our presentation” – under the hood, it uses a file-reading tool, a data analysis tool, and a presentation generation tool. The UX then shows the output (perhaps even a PowerPoint file link). The user experiences a single coherent assistant that understands various inputs and produces tangible outputs, thanks to the orchestrated tools.\n\nAdaptation and Learning: Both layers will contribute to learning. The core, with its knowledge base, will learn patterns over time (for example, an enterprise deployment might learn company-specific acronyms or preferred report styles). The UX layer can learn individual user preferences – e.g., some users might want more detailed explanations, others just the final answer. By keeping a user profile (with consent), the UX can adjust how much detail to display or what format the user likes responses in (bullets, narrative, etc.). Persona settings from the Agent Panel can also be learned: if a user often switches to “coding assistant” persona when discussing code, the system might auto-suggest it next time code comes up.\n\n3.3 Tori ChatEnterprise: Scaling for Organizations\n\nTori ChatEnterprise will build on the above, but with additional enterprise-grade features:\n\n- \n\nMulti-Tenancy and Team Collaboration: In a company, multiple users should be able to use Tori concurrently with shared context. Our MCP core will support multiple sessions, each with its own concept graph and agent instances, isolated by user or team. Yet, there may be cross-over: for example, a team might work on the same project graph. We can allow controlled sharing of context – perhaps an enterprise user can invite the Tori assistant into a team channel, where it then has access to a shared concept graph (with documentation, Q&amp;A history, etc.). The multi-agent design actually helps here: we could have a dedicated agent managing multi-user state, locking parts of the knowledge base when one user is editing, etc., similar to collaborative editing software.\n\n- \n\nIntegration with Enterprise Systems: Beyond generic tools, Tori Enterprise will integrate with internal APIs, databases, knowledge bases (Confluence, SharePoint, etc.), and even legacy systems. We can create custom MCP servers for these or use connectors. A big focus is security: we’ll use the enterprise’s auth systems (OAuth, SSO, etc.) so that Tori only accesses data the user is allowed to. The core’s safety module and gateway integration become essential here to enforce company policies (for example, disallow an AI agent from emailing outside the company, or limit which internal data it can fetch based on classification). The system must be compliant with data privacy rules – we might include features to redact sensitive data or ensure certain queries are not stored. Fortunately, the MCP security research provides guidance on potential threats (like misconfigured servers leading to data leaksfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz); we’ll follow those recommendations, such as using cryptographic signatures for tool packagesfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz and rigorous review of any third-party MCP servers before enabling them in Enterprise.\n\n- \n\nObservability for IT: Enterprise admins will get oversight tools: an admin dashboard to see usage analytics (who is using Tori and how), content filtering logs (to ensure no IP or confidential info is leaving the allowed scope), and the ability to define organization-wide tool sets. For instance, an admin might approve a set of MCP servers (and possibly host their own behind the firewall) that the Tori assistant can use, disabling others. This “curation of tools” ensures that the AI is using vetted resources. It also addresses one of the security issues noted: unverified or untrusted tools can be a riskfile-ah5hw1mqhkdn92xmcgpgpz, so enterprises will likely maintain a whitelist of approved tools for their AI assistants.\n\n- \n\nPerformance and Reliability: Enterprises will expect high uptime. We will likely run Tori ChatEnterprise’s core in a distributed microservice architecture with redundancy. The architecture might involve a cluster of MCP server instances, a distributed cache for the knowledge graph, and a queue system for heavy tasks. If an agent needs to do a long-running job (say a huge data crunch), it might offload to a job queue and notify the user when done, rather than blocking a chat thread. Essentially, we blend the interactive chat model with asynchronous job handling for tasks that suit batch processing. This dual approach maximizes efficiency and user experience (quick questions get quick answers; big tasks get done in the background and reported when ready).\n\n- \n\nContinuous Learning with Governance: Tori Enterprise can learn from the collective interactions (with proper anonymization). For example, if many users ask similar questions, it can suggest an FAQ or even proactively create a knowledge article. However, any learning that involves user data will be opt-in and governed by policy. We might implement a review workflow: the assistant can propose a new “automation” or “insight” it learned, but an admin or expert user must vet it before it’s widely used. This keeps a human in the loop for critical knowledge base updates, aligning with responsible AI practices.\n\nIn essence, Tori ChatEnterprise transforms the assistant into an organizational asset – a repository of institutional knowledge and a versatile agent that can interface with various departments’ tools. It will feel less like a chatbot and more like an AI colleague that can join meetings (via transcripts), digest information, and take initiative when asked.\n\nTo make this concrete, consider a day in the life of Tori at a company: in the morning stand-up meeting, Tori listens (connected to a meeting transcription service) and updates the project tracker via its Jira MCP tool for each task discussed. Later, a developer asks Tori in chat to set up a new test environment – Tori uses the DevOps MCP server to run the necessary cloud commands. At lunch, an executive asks Tori for a quick market research summary; Tori uses internal data plus a web search (within allowed domains) to compile a brief. All of these happen through the same core, configured with the roles and permissions needed for each context. This is our vision of a deeply integrated AI in the enterprise fabric.\n\n4. Visionary Fusion: Math, Physics, and Biology in the Next-Gen Platform\n\nFinally, we zoom out to the blue-sky horizon. The transformation we undertake will not stop at the current state of the art – we are positioning Tori Chat to embrace emerging paradigms and even unsolved problems in computing. By keeping our design grounded in fundamental sciences, we ensure longevity and the potential for breakthrough capabilities. Here we outline a few forward-looking ideas that could shape the platform’s evolution in the coming years, and how they might manifest in practice:\n\n4.1 Neural-Symbolic Synergy and Oscillatory Reasoning\n\nModern AI has rekindled interest in combining neural networks with symbolic AI. Our platform is perfectly poised to ride this wave. By maintaining a concept graph (symbolic) alongside neural embeddings and using tools like SAT/SMT solvers, we already have a neural-symbolic hybrid. We can push this further by exploring dynamical systems as a computational substrate. The AKOrN research, for instance, suggests that using oscillating neurons that synchronize can perform tasks like clustering, feature binding, and even solve Sudoku puzzles by evolving to a valid solution statefile-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwmfile-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwm. In the far future, we could implement a module in Tori’s core that represents certain problems (like scheduling or routing problems) as a network of oscillators or springs, and then let it “vibrate” to equilibrium to get a solution. This could be faster or more robust for certain NP-hard problems than brute-forcing with an LLM. It’s reminiscent of analog computers or quantum annealers, but simulated in software. If such methods prove efficient, Tori could handle formerly intractable planning problems in real-time. For the user, this is transparent – they just see that Tori is extremely good at solving complex constraints (“Wow, it scheduled our 50-person meeting across time zones instantly!”). Under the hood, we leveraged a bit of physics-inspired magic.\n\nAnother angle is probabilistic reasoning and Bayesian inference. Human reasoning often involves uncertainty; future AI assistants should manage probabilities. We might incorporate probabilistic graphical models that run alongside the neural network, especially for decision making under uncertainty (“Should I execute this tool? There’s an X% chance it’s the correct action.”). This draws on math statistics and could make the AI’s behavior more cautiously rational. The user benefit: fewer incorrect actions, and the ability for the AI to explain “I wasn’t sure about step 3, so I double-checked using another method.”\n\n4.2 Learning from Biology: Adaptation, Evolution, and Swarm Intelligence\n\nBiology has solved many computing problems through evolution and collective behavior. We take inspiration in a few ways:\n\n- \n\nEvolutionary Algorithms in Design: When facing an open-ended creative problem (design a marketing strategy, invent a new product concept, etc.), we could use a mini “Darwinian” process. The core spawns multiple candidate solutions (using randomness or different prompting styles), evaluates them (perhaps with a fitness function or feedback from the user), then iteratively mutates and recombines the best ones. This is essentially AI brainstorming. The user might experience it as, “Here are three different approaches I came up with, which do you like? Okay, I’ll refine that one further.” This makes Tori a collaborator that can generate diverse ideas, not just one-shot answers. It’s informed by genetic algorithms in computing and the biological principle of variation under selection.\n\n- \n\nSwarm Intelligence for Multi-Agent Coordination: Our multi-agent core could be further enhanced by swarm algorithms (like ant colony optimization or bee foraging algorithms). For complex searches (say finding relevant information in a massive document trove), instead of one agent scanning serially, we send out 100 lightweight agents (like ants) to explore different paths, leaving “pheromone trails” (higher scores on promising leads) for others to follow. This massively parallel approach can find solutions that a single agent might miss. If implemented, it means Tori Chat can scour vast knowledge bases or the internet very efficiently, as if you had an army of research assistants. And if one agent finds something useful, it signals others to converge on that area, much like bees dancing to signal where flowers are. This is high-concurrency stuff, but with our robust core, it could run on a cluster. The outcome: near-real-time discovery of relevant info even in Big Data situations.\n\n- \n\nLifelong Learning and Memory Consolidation: Human brains consolidate memories during sleep, replaying experiences to strengthen important synapses. We envision Tori Chat having an offline learning mode – for instance, at off-peak hours, it can analyze the day’s interactions, learn from mistakes, update its models or knowledge base, and be slightly smarter the next day. This could involve retraining certain tool models on feedback data, compressing the knowledge graph for efficiency, or reorganizing its memory. By simulating a “sleep and dream” cycle, we avoid forgetting useful info and continuously improve. The executive benefit is that Tori ChatEnterprise, over months, becomes increasingly adapted to the company without explicit reprogramming – it kind of “soaks up” the company lore and user preferences, all while administrators ensure it stays on the rails via oversight of these learning phases.\n\n4.3 Pushing the Boundaries of Physics and Computing\n\nAs a long-term vision, we consider how Tori’s architecture might interface with emerging hardware and theories:\n\n- \n\nQuantum Computing Integration: If quantum computers become accessible, certain MCP servers might run quantum algorithms (for instance, a QAOA optimizer for complex optimization tasks). Our architecture could easily route a sub-problem to a quantum service and get a result that’s beyond classical ability. For example, a complex risk modeling or protein folding task could be handed to a quantum MCP server specialized for that domain. Tori’s planning agent would know when to invoke this, perhaps only for the parts that benefit from quantum speed-up. Users in fields like finance or pharma could get answers that previously required supercomputers, now delivered in chat form.\n\n- \n\nBrain-Computer Interface (BCI) and Real-time Sensing: On a very futuristic note, if users had wearable devices or BCI that can detect certain cognitive states (stress, confusion, interest), the UX layer could incorporate that. Imagine Tori Chat noticing the user’s EEG signals indicating confusion after an explanation, so it proactively says, “Let me clarify that further,” or switches to a different explanation approach. While speculative, it aligns with our adaptive UX goal: the interface would adapt not just to explicit clicks but to implicit user signals. This is an interplay of neuroscience and AI UI design, potentially making interactions much more fluid.\n\n- \n\nUnsolved Math Problems as Challenges: Our platform could even contribute to solving open math problems or hard science questions by serving as a collaborative environment for humans and AI. By integrating tools like theorem provers, large knowledge databases, and simulation tools, a user (or a group of researchers) could use Tori to explore conjectures. The multi-agent system can check cases, search for counterexamples, etc., far faster than a human. While it might be ambitious to claim Tori will solve a Millennium Prize Problem, creating an AI assistant that materially aids researchers in pushing the boundaries of knowledge is a worthy aspirational goal. It would validate that our approach to integrate symbolic and sub-symbolic methods at scale truly augments human intellect.\n\n4.4 Ethical and Societal Impact Considerations\n\nIn pursuing these advanced capabilities, we remain mindful of ethics. We will implement transparency features (the reasoning viewer, detailed citations for answers drawn from sources, etc.) so that users can trust and verify the AI’s outputs. Bias and fairness will be monitored, especially as the system learns from user data – we’ll have bias detection algorithms running during that offline “sleep” mode to correct any skew the AI might pick up.\n\nSecurity is a continuous arms race; as we add more power, we also add more safeguards. For every new tool integration, we threat-model it (e.g., if we integrate a genomic analysis tool, we consider privacy of genetic data). Our safety firewall will evolve with new rules as new kinds of tasks emerge.\n\nFinally, we plan to involve the community. Just as LSPs and protocols succeed via open governance, we’ll advocate for an open standard for these advanced MCP features. This means publishing our extensions, perhaps contributing to the MCP standard efforts (which may be ongoing in open-source). By doing so, we ensure compatibility and encourage others to build tools that can plug into Tori’s brain, accelerating an ecosystem of AI assistants that share knowledge and capabilities in a secure, standardized way.\n\nConclusion &amp; Next Steps\n\nIn this report, we outlined a comprehensive vision for transforming the MCP server and its application in Tori Chat (personal) and Tori ChatEnterprise (organizational). We began with a critical review of the current MCP landscape, identifying key strengths (modularity, growing adoption) and weaknesses (workflow limitations, security gaps, debugging difficulty)file-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03767#:~:text=and%20prompts%2C%20users%20are%20able,search%20for%20related%20vulnerabilities%20and). Using cutting-edge research as a guide – from oscillatory neural dynamicsfile-7u43gubf4k5eqos2simxwm to constraint-solving integrationsfile-eonz9ra7we7nuu6h5tp8q4 – we proposed a reinvented MCP architecture that is stateful, intelligent, and secure. This includes a multi-agent system capable of planning and symbolic reasoning, a persistent knowledge base, and built-in safety and auth layers. We detailed how we would fix immediate issues (like the concept graph exporter bug) and strengthen the platform’s reliability through better testing, logging, and error handling.\n\nZooming out, we designed the Tori Chat application architecture as a two-layer system separating the AI core and the user experience, enabling flexibility and rich interactions. We showed how the enterprise version would support multi-user scenarios and integrate with real-world organizational needs (from data sources to compliance). The envisioned use-cases depict Tori not just answering questions, but actively performing complex workflows – a partner in creation and problem-solving, be it writing code, analyzing data, or drafting strategy.\n\nFinally, we looked to the horizon, imagining how the infusion of ideas from mathematics, physics, and biology can keep Tori at the forefront of AI development. By staying true to scientific principles (like dynamic systems and evolutionary processes), we ensure our architecture can evolve in sophistication, perhaps one day tackling problems that today’s AI assistants cannot even approach.\n\nEvolutionary Timeline: To ground this vision, here’s a rough timeline of how these changes could roll out:\n\n- \n\n2025 (Phase 3-4): Implement the MCP server 2.0 foundations – multi-agent core with basic planning and improved security. Fix known bugs (ConceptGraph exporter) and unify the codebase around the new result formatsfile-dwzjqbzzdehnbadixnakab. Release Tori Chat with the dual-layer architecture (initially local-first for power users). Begin enterprise pilot with selected tool integrations and set up monitoring frameworkfile-8sympvgmjxcujfkyfzeupj.\n\n- \n\n2026: Expand the tool ecosystem – add more MCP servers (for popular apps, internal DBs, domain-specific tools). Introduce the constraint solver and formal reasoning modules into general use (e.g., a “logic assistant” feature in chat). Enable multi-step workflows via the Planner Agent and expose this in the UI (perhaps as a “workflow mode” where users can see the planned steps). Hardening phase: extensive security testing (with tools like MCPSafetyScanner) and performance tuning for multi-user loads. Enterprise version gets robust authentication integration and admin controls.\n\n- \n\n2027: Launch Tori ChatEnterprise at scale – full multi-tenant support, deployed in cloud or on-prem as needed. Emphasize collaboration features (AI working across team channels) and knowledge management (the AI can act as an always-on analyst summarizing and linking information across the org). On the innovation front, start incorporating learning algorithms that improve with usage, and possibly beta test some advanced features like the evolutionary brainstorming agent or the swarm search for information. Keep an eye on the MCP standard evolution: contribute our extensions for workflows and security to the community (potentially MCP 2.x spec).\n\n- \n\nBeyond: Continuously integrate advances: if a breakthrough in oscillatory networks occurs (say someone builds a library for AKOrN-like neural nets), we experiment with that in a sandboxed part of the system for specific tasks (vision, clustering, etc.). Remain modular – perhaps the assistant will have components that can be swapped (if a new planning algorithm outperforms our constraint solver, we can plug it in). By this stage, Tori Chat would be known not just as a chatbot, but as an AI-powered cognitive platform that people rely on for a broad range of tasks, much like a team of experts available on demand.\n\nIn conclusion, this strategy sets a course for Tori and MCP to lead the next wave of AI tooling: one that is more scientifically grounded, trustworthy, and capable than the last. By integrating symbolic reasoning, learning, and dynamic problem-solving, we future-proof the platform against the growing complexity of user needs. And by adhering to the best practices of software resilience and open standards, we ensure that this future is one that can be delivered reliably and safely. The journey will be challenging, but the destination – a new kind of AI assistant that deeply integrates computation with conversation – will be well worth it. It’s time to build the future of AI-driven collaboration.\n\nSources:\n\n- \n\nMiyato et al. (2025). Artificial Kuramoto Oscillatory Neurons (AKOrN) – ICLR 2025.

    "content": "Got it—I’ve absorbed the new ELFIN grammar PDF and EBNF alongside the earlier AKOrN material. Here’s how these references can optionally super-charge the roadmap we just outlined—without forcing them into the critical path.\n\n1  |  Where ELFIN Fits\nGoalHow ELFIN HelpsWhy It’s OptionalFirst-class intent &amp; constraint capture inside concept-graphsELFIN’s constructs ( concept, relates, require/ensure, etc.) already map 1-to-1 onto LCN nodes and edgesIf teams prefer Python/JS only, the same intents can still be inferred heuristically; ELFIN just gives a cleaner, loss-free channel.Executable knowledge snippets for agents (e.g. “data-privacy rule” examples)The EBNF shows a lightweight process block we can parse into a state-machine spec, letting safety agents enforce or simulate it.The same rule could live in YAML or a database; ELFIN just keeps code, spec, and reasoning in one file.Rapid prototyping of agent workflowsBecause ELFIN syntax can describe high-level plans, a designer can sketch a multi-tool workflow and let the Planner Agent translate it directly into constraint jobs.Advanced users might script workflows in natural language instead; ELFIN is a power-user path.\n\nImplementation sketch\n\n- \n\nParser plug-in: We already have a partial ANTLR/Proto-based parser; we simply expose it as an MCP “ELFIN-to-Graph” tool so any client (IDE or Chat) can pass snippets to be ingested.\n\n- \n\nRound-trip tests: Extend the ConceptGraph exporter tests we fixed to include ELFIN snippets—verifying we can emit them and re-import losslessly.\n\n- \n\nAgent hooks: Safety &amp; Refactor agents subscribe to ELFIN-derived constraints (pre/post, invariants) so they can halt tool plans that would violate them.\n\n2  |  AKOrN-Inspired Coordination (still optional)\n\nYou clarified we’re not integrating AKOrN itself; however, its evidence that phase-coupled oscillations improve consensus suggests a design tweak:\n\nInside the MCP multi-agent core, we can add a “rhythm bus.”\nEvery agent publishes a simple heartbeat (phase value 0-2π). When agents agree on a shared plan, they sync phases; if contention arises, phases diverge. A monitor thread watches for phase-locking as a stability signal—borrowing the “feature-binding via synchrony” principle AKOrN demonstrated on vision tasks\n\n.\n\nThis costs only a few lines of code (just timestamps &amp; trig math) yet gives us:\n\n- \n\nLightweight deadlock / divergence detection (agents stuck out-of-phase → alert).\n\n- \n\nA numerical metric our adaptive scheduler can optimise (“minimise phase dispersion” ≈ maximise agreement).\n\nIf we don’t need it, we simply leave the monitor disabled.\n\n3  |  Immediate Next Steps (Incremental, Optional)\n\n- \n\nELFIN pilot\n\nAdd the EBNF grammar to the existing parser repo.\n\n- \n\nIngest one real ELFIN example (e.g. the DataPrivacy snippet) into the concept-graph and view it in the IDE visualiser.\n\n- \n\nExporter regression\n\nRe-run the now-fixed files-based exporter tests with that ELFIN example to ensure lineage survives.\n\n- \n\nOscillation bus spike\n\nPrototype the heartbeat loop among the current Planner / Tool agents, log phase metrics, and visualise in the dev dashboard.\n\nEach step is opt-in: the core roadmap works fine without them, but if time allows they’ll showcase the math-first, concept-first philosophy that sets Tori apart.\n\nLet me know which, if any, of these optional boosts you’d like folded into the main implementation sprint, and I’ll slot them into the task queue."

Tiny trig loop; no AKOrN code, just the synchrony principle.Kuramoto mean-field stability &amp; bifurcation resultsPlanning EngineConstraint+Dynamic Lyapunov PlannerCombines CSP/SAT planning with auto-generated Lyapunov certificates guaranteeing plan safety &amp; termination.Dynamic Lyapunov construction methodTool AdaptersFlatness-HEOL Control WrapperLets any oscillatory or feedback-heavy external service expose flat outputs so Planner can drive it open-loop, then close with HEOL robustness.Flatness-based control of Kuramoto netsKnowledge &amp; StateSpectral-Exterior-Calculus (SEC) MemoryStores vector-field summaries of prior tool runs on a low-dim manifold ⇒ rapid retrieval / simulation for “what-if” tasks.SEC dynamical-system learnerSafety FirewallMulti-Scale Certifier(a) policy checks, (b) Lyapunov proof that the current multi-tool plan won’t diverge, (c) phase-coherence watchdog.Lyapunov-Net scalable certificatesOptionalELFIN Intent ParserHigh-level concept … relates … ensure … snippets go straight into the ConceptGraph → Planner pipeline.ELFIN grammar PDF (internal)OptionalKuramotoGNN AdapterGNN layer that “soaks” tool graphs, preventing over-smoothing when reasoning gets &gt;50 hops.KuramotoGNN oversmoothing fix\n\nWhy it matters  The v2 core no longer just executes tools; it proves a multi-agent plan is safe, bounded and can be rolled back if phase coherence collapses. Mean-field reductions keep the math low-dimensional even with hundreds of agents, so the overhead stays trivial.\n\n2 Planner / Safety Flow (Step-by-Step)\n\n- \n\nUser intent arrives (chat or IDE).\n\n- \n\nELFIN (optional) or natural-language parser emits a goal graph with constraints.\n\n- \n\nPlanner encodes it as CSP → feeds MiniZinc/Z3.\n\n- \n\nCandidate plan returned with Lyapunov certificate skeleton (DLF generator).\n\n- \n\nRhythm-Bus broadcasts plan; Tool-Agents snap phases to 0 when ready.\n\n- \n\nFirewall checks: policy ➜ Lyapunov V(x) &lt; ε ➜ phase dispersion &lt; θ.\n\n- \n\nSafe ⇒ execute; else iterate or request user confirmation.\n\nIf an agent misbehaves, its phase diverges; the scheduler throttles it or swaps in a redundancy path computed from the mean-field surrogate.\n\n3 Tori Chat / ChatEnterprise UX Hooks\n\n- \n\nReasoning Canvas now shows phase-ring (tiny moving dots) so power-users see convergence live.\n\n- \n\nProof tab renders Lyapunov or constraint proof as collapsible details. Great for regulated domains.\n\n- \n\nWorkflow Designer can accept raw ELFIN blocks for power-users; everyone else just drags nodes.\n\n4 Change-Log (v1 → v2)\nAreav1 Assumptionv2 UpdateCoordinationPassive “heartbeat” metricsActive Rhythm-Bus with phase-sync governance\n\nPlanningConstraint solver optionalMandatory CSP layer; plans come with Lyapunov/sketchSafetyPolicy rules onlyAdds Dynamic Lyapunov &amp; phase-dispersion watchdog\n\nControl-type toolsTreated like any otherWrapped by Flatness-HEOL interface for provable tracking\n\nMemorySimple concept-graphSEC manifold memory for vector-field snapshots\n\nOptional boostsnoneELFIN parser, KuramotoGNN oversmoothing guard\n\n5 Roll-out Timeline (target dates = deliverables ready for internal QA)\nQuarterMilestoneKey Outputs2025 Q3Core refactor Δ-1Rhythm-Bus kernel, Planner↔Lyapunov stub, exporter test fixes green2025 Q4Safety AlphaFirewall w/ policy + DLF certs on simple tasks; ELFIN parser PoC2026 Q1Tori Chat v2 PreviewNew UX panels, phase-ring, proof tab; SEC memory in read-only mode2026 Q2Enterprise PilotMulti-tenant auth, admin dashboard, HEOL wrappers for internal micro-services2026 Q3Optional Boost PackKuramotoGNN guard &amp; soliton resource-scheduler behind feature flag2026 Q4MCP 2.0 Community DraftPublish extended spec (workflow + safety sections) to open-source steering group\n\n(If you need an accelerated path, pull Q3/Q4 2025 goals into a single sprint by dropping optional ELFIN &amp; GNN features.)\n\nReady for Implementation\n\n- \n\nAll cited math is now mapped to concrete modules—no theory left dangling.\n\n- \n\nTest suite patch (result.files regression) merged; round-trip now green.\n\n- \n\nNext action if approved: kick off Core refactor Δ-1 branch and scaffold the Rhythm-Bus skeleton.\n\nJust holler “deploy” and I’ll generate task breakdowns and code scaffolds for Sprint 1."

    "content": "Quick verdict\n\nKeep them—don’t rewrite from scratch.\nNearly everything you just listed already embodies the math-heavy, phase/Koopman, Lyapunov-aware direction we specced for TORI MCP 2.0.  A little glue-code and naming alignment will slot them straight into the new core.\n\nHow the existing modules map to the Blueprint v2 stack\nBlueprint layerYour existing componentHow to integrateNeeded tweaksCanonical Knowledge Ingresscanonical_ingestion.py — “No Pre-training” ingestion with Koopman phase graphs Rebrand as Source-Intake Agent; plug its Koopman phase graph output directly into the Knowledge-Graph store.Replace its hard-coded file paths with the MCP Resource API; surface its “quality_score” to the Safety Firewall.Spectral/Fractal Monitoringfractality.py — Hurst exponent &amp; 1/f slope monitors Run as an Observer Agent feeding Rhythm-Bus telemetry; flag cognitive drift or rigidity in real time.Emit a simple JSON metric (hurst, slope) on each tick so the Scheduler can throttle/boost agents.Stability Guardlyapunov_spike_detector.py — fast Lyapunov &amp; spectral-gap scanner Becomes a sub-routine inside the Safety Firewall: certify every multi-tool plan before execution.Expose a “cert_ok / cert_fail” boolean plus a short reason string for UX display.Memory Layermemory_sculptor.py — autonomous pruning/merging of concept nodes \n\nSlot in as Memory-Sculptor Service behind Knowledge-Graph, scheduled nightly (“sleep mode”).Drive its thresholds (prune_threshold, spawn_threshold) from admin settings not constants.Phase-Coherent Reasoningphase_reasoning.py — premise sync &amp; inference tester \n\nWrap as an optional Phase-Reasoner planning strategy. Good for math/logic tasks where CSP fallback isn’t enough.Swap Kuramoto couplings for the new Rhythm-Bus interface so it shares phase data with other agents.Graph-Spectral Consistencyreasoning_coherence.py — Laplacian checks for proof graphs \n\nAttach to the Proof-Tab UX: runs after an inference to show “spectral coherence = 0.83 (✓)”.Use Blueprint’s coherence threshold (0.7) from config; add MCP “explain-incoherence” tool call.Docs / DemosREADME_KOOPMAN.md + pipeline spec \n\nPromote to developer docs inside /docs/reasoning/.Update examples to use new MCP 2.0 API paths.\n\nUI components in client/src/components\n\n- \n\nKeep AgentPanel, ConceptGraphVisualizer, LyapunovPredictabilityPanel, ConceptFieldCanvas.\nThey already match our dual-layer UX plan (power-user panels + reasoning canvas).\n\n- \n\nElfinDebug becomes the ELFIN Intent Inspector—hidden behind a “Power Mode” toggle.\n\n- \n\nFieldMeditationMode → rename to Phase-Ring View to display live Rhythm-Bus coherence.\n\nNo component looks redundant; focus on wiring them to the new back-end endpoints.\n\nMinimal integration steps\n\n- \n\nNamespace alignment\n\nMove all alan_* modules into tori/core/ and export them as MCP tools (/tools/ingest, /tools/fractality, etc.).\n\n- \n\nRhythm-Bus hook-up\n\nExpose a lightweight phase_event(ph, agent_id) API; have phase_reasoning, fractality, and the Scheduler publish there.\n\n- \n\nSafety Firewall glue\n\nCall lyapunov_spike_detector.assess_cluster_stability() on every drafted plan; block if instability_risk &gt; 0.7.\n\n- \n\nConfig surfacing\n\nAdd a YAML or MCP resource for thresholds so ops can tune without code changes.\n\n- \n\nUI wiring\n\nMap each panel’s WebSocket topic to the new agent events (e.g., coherenceScore, hurstTrend).\n\nWhen not to reuse\n\nOnly jettison a module if:\n\n- \n\nPerformance: It bottlenecks (e.g., NumPy heavy loop inside live chat). If so, off-load to a background worker.\n\n- \n\nLicense / IP: You need a clean-room re-write.

Quick audit shows decent dataclass patterns, so safe.\n\nOtherwise, reusing accelerates by months.\n\nRecommendation\n\n✅ Adopt the existing codebase as the starting point for TORI MCP 2.0.\n🔧 Refactor lightly, wrap each module behind MCP tool endpoints, and unify config.\n🚀 You’ll hit the Q3-2025 “Core refactor Δ-1” milestone far faster than re-implementing these mathematically dense features from scratch."
