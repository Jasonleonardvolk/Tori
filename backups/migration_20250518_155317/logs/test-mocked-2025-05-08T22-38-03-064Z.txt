[STDERR] FAIL client/src/__tests__/integration/RefactorService_EditorSyncService/RefactorService_EditorSyncService.test.js
[STDERR]   ● Test suite failed to run

    Cannot find module './mockEditorSyncService' from 'client/src/__tests__/integration/RefactorService_EditorSyncService/RefactorService_EditorSyncService.test.js'

    However, Jest was able to find:
    	'./mockEditorSyncService.mock.js'

    You might want to include a file extension in your import, or update your 'moduleFileExtensions', which is currently ['js', 'mjs', 'cjs', 'jsx', 'ts', 'tsx', 'json', 'node'].

    See https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#modulefileextensions-arraystring
