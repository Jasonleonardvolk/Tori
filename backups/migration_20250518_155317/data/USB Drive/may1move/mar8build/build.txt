 I will be building an auction website that is very robust with our own appraisal system based of our our predictive pricing model with other features similar to VAUTO. 


Logical Flow:

Starts with user interaction (dealer queries and bidder inputs).
Progresses logically through LCM, LAM, Falcon-7B, and other components.
Clearly integrates predictive valuation and dashboard enhancements.
Feedback Loop:

The inclusion of a feedback loop ensures iterative improvement and user engagement.
Separation of Concerns:

Tasks like context parsing (LCM), narrative commentary (LLM), and TTS are modular.
Comprehensive Pathways: 	

Covers key user-facing outputs like dashboards and virtual auctioneer functionality.

Iâ€™ll need a modular approach combining AI-driven capabilities, capable of handling diverse functionalities.  

I have a comprehensive list of datasets to train the models on.  

--Problem with optimization

I'll also be integrating Text-to-speech (TTS) technology: LLaSA-3B: A Llama 3.2B.  


I'll be Utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to improve memory retention and contextual understanding for:  a. Memory-Augmented Attention, b. Pre-Encoder Layer, c. Post-Decoder Memory Refinement. --Insert LSTM and other memory retention

Any Attention Mechanism's.  I came up with this: (see attention image)
Should we consider How are sentences turned into a vector in LLM?
Where does GSPN fit in?
Trainer API 
Multi-Modal Embeddings
k-NN Algorithm
Hugging Face Transformers
Do we implement Lora or the other? Transformer^2: Self-adaptive LLMs
Customizing TTS Voices for Context, Gender, Dialects, and Styles

customizable user dashboards with enhanced analytics

Live Polls and Audience Participation

Virtual Auctioneer Avatars

Narrative-Driven Auctions

Enable story-like vehicle descriptions for user engagement.
