# TORI Chat Build System Fix Summary

## Problems Fixed

The TORI Chat UI was incorrectly building a placeholder redirect page instead of the full React chat interface. This was due to:

1. The Vite build configuration not explicitly specifying the correct entry point
2. Environment variables not properly set to use chat mode instead of demo mode
3. The CLINE terminal loop causing confusion when running commands
4. Turborepo configuration issue ("pipeline" vs "tasks" field)
5. Incorrect script path in index.html (`/main.jsx` instead of `/src/main.jsx`)
6. React dependency conflicts with react-diff-viewer requiring older React versions
7. Missing vite package causing build failures
8. Port conflicts (EADDRINUSE) preventing the server from starting
9. Permission issues with turbo.exe being locked by other processes

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Build Configuration

- Updated `tori_chat_frontend/vite.config.js` to explicitly set the entry point to src/index.html:
  ```js
  build: {
    outDir: 'dist',
    emptyOutDir: true,
    rollupOptions: {
      input: {
        main: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/index.html')  // Ensures correct entry point
      }
    }
  },
  ```

### 2. Added Environment Configuration

- Created/updated `tori_chat_frontend/.env.production` with:
  ```
  VITE_APP_MODE=chat
  PUBLIC_URL=/
  ```

### 3. Eliminated CLINE Terminal Confusion

- Updated `.vscode/settings.json` to:
  - Create "Ingest-Dev" terminal profile
  - Set it as the default Windows terminal profile

### 4. Fixed Turborepo Configuration

- Updated `turbo.json` to use "tasks" instead of "pipeline" (Turborepo 2.5.3 requirement)

### 5. Created Deployment Resources

- `deploy-tori-chat.bat`: One-click script to build and run the TORI Chat UI
- `verify-tori-build.js`: Tool to verify the build is correct, not the redirect page
- `TORI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`: Detailed documentation on deployment process

## Correct Deployment Method

The most reliable way to build and deploy the TORI Chat UI is:

```
cd C:\Users\jason\Desktop\tori\kha\tori_chat_frontend
npm ci --omit dev
npx vite build
node start-production.cjs
```

Then access the UI at http://localhost:3000

## Verification

A properly built TORI Chat UI will:

1. Have an index.html file that's significantly larger than 100 bytes
2. Not contain text about being "redirected" or "Go to demo"
3. Include references to JavaScript assets in the assets/ directory
4. Show the full React-based chat interface, not a placeholder

Run the verification script to confirm: `node verify-tori-build.js`
