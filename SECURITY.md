# Security Considerations for ELFIN Language Tools

## VS Code Extension Security

### Direct Installation Approach

The ELFIN Language Support VS Code extension uses a direct installation approach rather than the conventional VSIX packaging. This decision was made for the following reasons:

1. **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: The npm ecosystem has many reported vulnerabilities in development dependencies that trigger security warnings but don't actually affect the extension's runtime behavior in VS Code.

2. **Minimal Runtime Requirements**: The extension only requires the `vscode-languageclient` module at runtime, making a full dependency tree unnecessary.

3. **Installation Simplicity**: Direct installation allows us to copy only what's needed and avoid bundling unnecessary dependencies.

4. **Isolation**: VS Code extensions run in their own process, isolated from user content, reducing the actual risk of dependency exploits.

### Security Measures

Our approach includes:

- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only required dependencies are copied to the installation
- **Documented Installation**: Clear instructions for reviewing what gets installed
- **No Privilege Escalation**: The extension runs with the same permissions as VS Code
- **Transparent Code**: All extension code is readable and reviewable

### Vulnerability Context

The npm audit warnings mainly relate to development-time tooling:

- PostCSS packages with reported vulnerabilities
- Development-only packages like webpack components
- Test frameworks and build tools not used at runtime

These don't pose a material risk to users of the extension since they are not executed when the extension is running in VS Code.

## Language Server Security

The ELFIN Language Server is implemented in Python and follows these security best practices:

- **Input Validation**: All user input is properly validated before processing
- **No Shell Execution**: File operations use Python's standard library rather than shell commands
- **Confined File Access**: Only reads/writes files explicitly requested by the client
- **Limited Network Access**: No outbound connections except to the LSP client
- **Clear Error Messaging**: Provides informative errors without exposing sensitive information

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover security issues in the ELFIN Language Tools, please report them to:

security@elfin-lang.org

Please include:
- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested mitigations

## Regular Auditing

We perform regular security reviews to:

1. Update dependencies when security patches are available
2. Review and test code changes for security implications
3. Validate LSP protocol handling for edge cases
4. Monitor for new vulnerability reports in dependencies
