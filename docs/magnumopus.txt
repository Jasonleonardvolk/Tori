TORI Phase 2 Integration Plan with Dashboard and Self-Evolution

TORI Architectural Evolution Integration Plan
Overview and Goals
TORI is an AI system that currently comprises Prajna (a real-time concept mesh reasoning engine) and ScholarSphere (an archival memory store). The goal of this evolution is to transform TORI into a reflexive, self-improving cognitive engine. This involves integrating three key capabilities into the architecture:
Darwin-Gödel Trigger Engine: a conditional strategy evolution engine that automatically improves TORI’s reasoning strategies. Instead of using isolated sandbox tests, it will use logical predicates based on TORI’s cognitive state to decide when and how to evolve its own algorithms

.
ψ‑LineageLedger: a ledger tracking the full lifecycle of concepts in TORI’s knowledge base – from creation through mutations and usage – along with measures of coherence and quality

. This provides traceability and a “family tree” of how ideas evolve over time.
Interactive Evolution Dashboard: a front-end control panel (built with SvelteKit) to visualize and govern TORI’s evolution. This dashboard will display real-time metrics (e.g. “mesh entropy” or concept graph health), allow parameter tuning, show lineage and performance timelines, and let developers trigger or audit evolution events manually.
The integration will be executed in phases – from initial setup through MVP, alpha testing, and finally production deployment – to ensure a safe, incremental rollout. At each phase, we will define specific goals, implement technical tasks, update architectural interfaces, and establish validation gates to verify success. Ultimately, this plan will result in a robust architecture (with clearly defined APIs and data structures) that enables continuous self-improvement while maintaining alignment and safety. 

Conceptual inspiration: The Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) concept uses an archive-driven self-improvement loop where a “parent” agent self-modifies to produce a “child” agent, which is then evaluated on benchmarks

. This process forms a branching tree of progressively improved agents (left). Inspired by DGM’s open-ended evolution, TORI will implement a similar loop for evolving its reasoning strategies and concepts. However, unlike DGM which relied on sandboxed trials, TORI’s evolution will be conditionally triggered by measurable cognitive conditions in real time

. This conditional approach ensures transparency (knowing why an evolution was invoked) and allows targeted, reversible changes if a new strategy underperforms

.
Architecture Overview
Proposed Architecture: The new architecture introduces a meta-cognitive control layer alongside Prajna and ScholarSphere. This layer consists of the Darwin-Gödel Evolution Engine (for strategy self-modification) and the ψ‑LineageLedger (for concept lifecycle tracking), with an external Evolution Dashboard UI for interactive control. Key components and interactions are:
Prajna (Core Engine): Continues to handle real-time reasoning with its dynamic ConceptMesh. Prajna will be instrumented to output internal metrics (e.g. concept coherence, reasoning failure counts, stale concept ratios) and to accept adjustments or new concepts from the evolution engine. It remains the “live cortex” of TORI

.
ScholarSphere (Archive): Remains as long-term memory and audit log of knowledge (ingested documents, validated answers, etc.), but will not directly participate in live reasoning (to avoid latency)

. However, the evolution engine can draw from ScholarSphere for context or periodically realign Prajna’s mesh with archived knowledge to prevent drift

.
Darwin-Gödel Evolution Engine: A new orchestrator module that monitors trigger conditions and coordinates self-improvement. It ingests metrics from Prajna and usage stats from ScholarSphere, evaluates logical predicates to decide if an evolution should occur, and if so, selects or generates a new “meta-strategy” to apply

. For example, if concept coherence drops or repeated reasoning failures are detected, the engine might trigger a strategy mutation

. The engine interfaces with Prajna via well-defined APIs – e.g. to inject a new reasoning subroutine, adjust weighting of algorithms, or introduce a synthesized concept. It also records every evolution event and outcome for later analysis (in the ledger and logs).
ψ‑LineageLedger: A unified store (likely a JSON-based log or small database table) that records each concept’s “life events”: its creation (birth), any mutations or merges (lineage relationships), usage frequency updates, transitions between phases (active vs archived), and eventual retirement
file-kvlbacyeymxkggzthay9f6
. It also stores quality scores like “ψ-phase coherence” for each concept – a measure of how consistently a concept is used and remains relevant across different reasoning phases. This ledger serves as the source of truth for concept lineage and will enable visualizing the concept mutation tree on the dashboard. Both Prajna and ScholarSphere will write to the ledger whenever they create or modify a concept, and the Darwin-Gödel engine will read from it to identify candidates for mutation or removal (e.g., flagging concepts that are aging or consistently failing)

.
Evolution Dashboard (SvelteKit UI): A web-based control panel that connects to TORI’s backend (via REST APIs or WebSockets) to provide real-time visibility and control

. The UI will be organized into sections for Prajna and ScholarSphere, plus shared global visualizations. For Prajna, the dashboard will offer controls like adjusting concept evolution parameters (e.g. filter which concept phases are allowed to mutate, weighting factors for different evolution strategies) and show live indicators (e.g. a “Mesh Entropy” display for concept graph health)

. For ScholarSphere, it will allow toggling ingestion modes (auto or manual), setting promotion criteria for archived concepts to re-enter the live mesh, and viewing a concept lifecycle timeline (age, usage, and “ψ-phase” alignment of archived concepts)

. Shared panels will include a 7D Cognitive Metrics Visualizer (plotting metrics like awareness, coherence, novelty, etc., over time) and a Strategy Timeline that shows when evolutions were triggered and how they impacted performance

. The UI will also feature an alert system to flag any anomalies (e.g. sudden spikes in mesh entropy or phase desynchronization between Prajna and ScholarSphere)

. It essentially provides a “consciousness control panel” for engineers to monitor and guide TORI’s self-evolution.
All components will communicate through well-defined interfaces. We will extend the existing FastAPI backend (used by Prajna) to expose new endpoints (e.g., for retrieving ledger data, current metrics, or triggering an evolution) and possibly use a shared in-memory state with persistent sync (for fast communication between modules)

. In addition, a WebSocket channel may be used to push live updates to the dashboard (for real-time charts as TORI’s state evolves)

. Critically, the architecture will include guardrails to ensure that self-modifications remain safe and beneficial. The Darwin-Gödel engine will only act when predicates indicate it’s warranted (preventing random chaotic changes

), and every change will be evaluated (via tests or metrics) before being fully promoted. There will be a provision to revert to a previous stable state if a new strategy degrades performance

, and a “promotion protocol” to decide when a synthetic concept or new strategy becomes permanent

. These safeguards, along with human oversight via the dashboard, will keep TORI’s evolution aligned with its intended goals. With this context in mind, we now break down the integration into phases:
Phase 0: Setup (Design & Preparation)
Goals: Establish the foundational design for TORI’s evolutionary upgrade. In this phase, we focus on planning the system changes, defining metrics and schemas, and setting up the development environment, without yet deploying major functional changes. The goal is to have a clear blueprint and the scaffolding in place for the new components. Key Tasks:
Define Evolution Triggers: Specify the set of cognitive and environmental predicates that will conditionally trigger strategy evolution

. For example, predicates might include: low coherence score (concept mesh becoming incoherent), high failure rate (Prajna failing to answer or requiring fallback repeatedly), concept usage decay (many stale or unused concepts)

, or phase transitions (significant changes in context or input domain). Document these conditions and the rationale for each.
Design Meta-Strategies: Enumerate the types of evolutionary strategies the system can employ when triggered. At this stage, outline a few candidate strategies such as: “Mutation” (tweak certain reasoning parameters or prompt patterns), “Fission” (split overly broad concepts into more precise sub-concepts), “Recombination” (merge or connect concepts to form higher-level abstractions), or invoking an external model to propose a code improvement (as in DGM)

. No actual code change occurs in Phase 0; we are creating a strategy playbook that the engine will use later.
ψ‑LineageLedger Schema: Design the data structure for the lineage ledger. Decide on an appropriate format (e.g., a JSON file, a lightweight database, or an in-memory Python dict with periodic persistence). Define what each ledger entry contains. For example, a single concept record might include: an ID or name, timestamp of creation, origin (extracted from user input, or generated by a strategy), links to parent concepts (if it’s a result of mutation or fusion), a list of child concepts (if it has spawned new ones), a current status (active in Prajna vs archived in ScholarSphere), a coherence score (ψ-phase coherence or similar), a usage count or recency indicator, and any flags (e.g. stale=true if not used recently, failed=true if it led to reasoning failures). Also plan for an event log within the ledger for each concept (e.g., mutated_at timestamps or notes when a concept was promoted or deprecated). This schema will be reviewed and refined in later phases, but Phase 0 should produce an initial blueprint

.
Interface Design: Specify the APIs and internal interfaces needed for the new components. This includes:
Backend Endpoints: Design REST API endpoints (or RPC functions) such as GET /metrics (returns current Prajna metrics like coherence, failure count, etc.), GET /ledger or GET /ledger/{conceptId} (returns lineage info), POST /evolve (to manually trigger the Darwin engine), GET /strategies (list available meta-strategies and maybe their status), and POST /strategy/activate (to apply a specific strategy, if needed for manual control). These will be implemented in later phases, but the design is done now for clarity and to avoid conflicts.
Internal Module Interfaces: Define how Prajna will call the Darwin-Gödel Engine. For example, there might be an Orchestrator class or module (call it DarwinGodelOrchestrator) with a method like check_evolution_trigger(metrics, context) that Prajna’s main loop can invoke at certain intervals (or after each question answered). If the check returns true, Prajna would call another method like apply_meta_strategy() to let the engine execute an evolution
file-kvlbacyeymxkggzthay9f6
. Also plan how the orchestrator will retrieve needed data – e.g., Prajna could pass a metrics dict and a context object (including things like reasoning_failures count, stale_concepts_ratio, etc. as in the earlier pseudocode)

.
UI Integration: Decide how the SvelteKit frontend will communicate with the backend. Likely via HTTP for on-demand data queries and via WebSocket or SSE for live updates. For example, when the dashboard loads, it might call GET /metrics and GET /ledger to populate displays, and also open a WebSocket to receive push notifications of events (like “new concept added” or “strategy X applied”). Define a preliminary wire protocol or message format for these live updates (e.g., JSON messages with a type field like concept_added or evolution_triggered).
Tech Stack Setup: Prepare the development environment for the new components. This includes initiating a SvelteKit project for the dashboard UI, and adding any required libraries such as Cytoscape.js or D3.js for graph visualization, and charting libraries for plotting metrics. Also, if not already in use, consider setting up a WebSocket capability on the FastAPI backend (e.g., using FastAPI’s WebSocket support or an ASGI server)

. Ensure the backend environment can support concurrent tasks if needed (for the orchestrator’s background processes).
Wireframe the Dashboard: Create a mock-up or wireframe of the Evolution Dashboard based on the requirements. Define the main UI sections and controls:
Prajna Panel: Controls for Concept Phase Filter (e.g., UI sliders to select min/max ψ-phase for concepts that can auto-evolve), Strategy Weighting (sliders or knobs to bias whether mutation vs fission vs recombination is favored in automatic evolution), Failure Trigger Threshold (input to set how many failures trigger a fallback concept creation)

, a Mesh Entropy gauge (a real-time indicator or simple progress bar showing concept graph entropy or health), and a Manual Trigger button (to inject a synthetic concept or force-run an evolution cycle on demand)

.
ScholarSphere Panel: Controls for Ingest Mode (toggle between auto ingestion of new content vs manual approval vs delayed batch ingestion), Concept Promotion Criteria (input thresholds for when archived concepts are fed back into Prajna’s live mesh – e.g., minimum confidence or citation count required)

, a Lifecycle Viewer (perhaps a table listing archived concepts with their age, usage count, last used date), and a Phase Harmony Monitor (indicator of divergence between ScholarSphere and Prajna – i.e., a measure of how out-of-sync the archived knowledge is with the live knowledge, the “ψ-desync”)

.
Global/Shared Panel: Design visualizations like the 7D Consciousness Visualizer – likely a multi-line chart showing metrics such as coherence, novelty, accuracy, etc. over a recent window (7 dimensions of cognitive state plotted over time)

. Also, the Strategy Replay Timeline – perhaps a timeline view with markers indicating when each strategy was applied and tooltips or details on performance changes

. The Concept Mutation Tree could be a graph view (node-link diagram) where nodes are concepts and edges show parent-child (mutation) relationships; the user can select a concept to highlight its ancestors/descendants, illustrating the lineage logged in ψ‑LineageLedger

. And an Alert/Notification area for any warnings (e.g., “Mesh entropy high – potential instability” or “No recent evolution – system stagnating”)

.
At this stage, the wireframe can be a simple diagram or even a text outline (as above). The goal is to have agreement on what will be built before coding the UI.
Initial Data and Safety Checks: Identify any immediate safety constraints that should be in place from the start. For instance, mark certain core modules or files as read-only so the system doesn’t attempt to rewrite truly critical code in early stages. Establish a convention for any code-generated files (perhaps put them in a separate directory and clearly version them). Decide how to handle failures – e.g., if the orchestrator crashes or misbehaves, how will Prajna fall back to normal operation? (Perhaps plan a simple fail-safe: if the Darwin engine is unresponsive or raises errors, Prajna will ignore it and proceed with default behavior.)
Architectural Interfaces (Phase 0 Outputs): By the end of Phase 0, we expect to have design documents or configurations for all new interfaces. This includes an API spec document listing the new endpoints and their request/response formats, a preliminary module dependency diagram, and the dashboard wireframe. We also establish any new interface boundaries in the codebase (for example, create placeholder classes or modules: an empty strategy_condition_engine.py in the codebase as a stub

, and perhaps a skeleton lineage_ledger.py module with just data structure definitions). These placeholders act as integration points so that in Phase 1 we can fill in the logic. Validation Gates (Phase 0): This phase is largely about design validation. Key gates to pass before moving to implementation are:
Design Review: Conduct a team review of the planned architecture and interfaces. All stakeholders should agree that the approach (Darwin-Gödel engine triggers, ledger schema, dashboard features) aligns with TORI’s goals and is technically feasible. The predicate conditions for evolution should be vetted to ensure they make sense and are measurable with data we can obtain

. The team should also double-check that no critical omission or security concern is present at the design level (for example, ensure that there is a plan for authenticating dashboard access if it exposes control over the AI).
Schema Test: Take a small set of existing concepts from Prajna and simulate how they would be represented in the ψ‑LineageLedger. For instance, manually create a JSON entry for a known concept, with dummy parent/child links, and see if this representation can capture all needed information. This is a sanity check of the schema. If possible, write a tiny prototype script that adds a concept to the ledger and retrieves it, just to validate the chosen storage approach (file or DB connections).
Metrics Availability Check: Verify that Prajna can indeed produce the metrics needed for triggers. This might involve running Prajna on a sample query with logging enabled to see if we can extract values for coherence or failure counts. If some metrics don’t exist yet, plan how to compute them (e.g., implement a placeholder coherence calculation that simply counts concept graph connectivity for now). Ensuring the data is there (or identifying any gaps early) is crucial.
No Regressions on Current System: It’s important that introducing the scaffolding (even if inactive) doesn’t break the current capabilities. For example, adding the new modules (even as stubs) to the codebase and importing them in Prajna should not cause any slowdown or errors. We should run the existing Q&A tasks with the new code structure (with the evolution engine basically doing nothing) to confirm nothing changes for end users at this stage.
Go/No-Go Decision: Before proceeding, do a “go/no-go” meeting where we confirm that the plan is sound and we have the green light to implement. The outcome of Phase 0 is a clear, shared understanding of how we will integrate these features. Once approved, we move to building the MVP.
Phase 1: MVP Implementation (Minimum Viable Product)
Goals: Develop a working minimum viable product that integrates the new components in a basic form. The MVP will demonstrate end-to-end functionality of the evolution loop on a small scale: the system will be able to detect a simple trigger condition and respond by executing a pre-defined strategy change, record the event in the ledger, and display some information on the dashboard. At this stage, the focus is on making the pieces communicate, not on full sophistication. We aim to have a closed loop where an evolution can actually occur and be observed, under controlled conditions. Technical Tasks:
Implement Conditional Trigger Logic: Build the core of the Darwin-Gödel Trigger Engine by implementing the predicate check and a simple strategy application. For MVP, choose one straightforward trigger condition and one strategy to apply. For example, implement evolve_strategy_if(metrics, context) to return true if “reasoning_failures > 2 AND stale_concepts_ratio > 0.6” (i.e., if more than 2 consecutive failures and over 60% of concepts are stale)

. This is a stand-in for a “the system is struggling” condition. If the condition is met, the engine will execute a basic strategy, say fallback concept injection: call a function to generate a new concept that could help (perhaps using an existing concept_synthesizer.py to create a concept bridging the knowledge gap)

. Implement this as a method apply_selected_strategy() which for now can do something simple like: create a dummy concept node (e.g., a combination of the two most frequently failing concepts) and insert it into Prajna’s ConceptMesh. The action should be logged (both to normal logs and to the ψ‑LineageLedger as an “evolution event”). Essentially, we want a tangible effect in the system when the trigger fires, but keep it minimal and safe (e.g., we won’t modify core code yet, just data).
Basic ψ‑LineageLedger Functionality: Develop the ledger module with minimal features. For MVP, it can be an in-memory Python dictionary or a JSON file on disk that the system appends to. Implement functions like ledger.add_concept(concept_id, parents=[...]) and ledger.update_usage(concept_id) and ensure Prajna calls these at appropriate places. For example, when Prajna extracts a new concept from user input or a document, call add_concept (with no parents, since it’s original). When the Darwin engine creates a new concept via mutation, call add_concept(child_id, parents=[parent_id])

. If a concept is used in answering a query, call update_usage to increment a counter. Also include a simple method to retrieve lineage, e.g., ledger.get_lineage(concept_id) that returns its ancestors or descendants by traversing the stored links. The data structure might be very simple (e.g., a dict of concept_id -> record dict), but it should be structured enough to expand later. As part of this, implement tracking of a coherence score in a rudimentary way – for instance, initialize each concept’s coherence to 1.0 and perhaps decrement it slightly each time it fails to be relevant, or use a placeholder value. This will be refined, but having a field in place is good.
Connect Ledger to System Events: Modify Prajna and the new orchestrator to actually use the ledger. For MVP, this means after each query or reasoning cycle, Prajna invokes something like ledger.update_usage for all concepts that were involved in answering. When the orchestrator’s strategy creates a concept, ensure it calls ledger.add_concept. Also, when a concept is moved to archive (if that happens in this phase), mark it in the ledger (e.g., set status to “archived”). In short, wire up the events we already know about to keep the ledger updated. This will immediately give us data to display.
Build a Simplified Dashboard: Start implementing the SvelteKit dashboard with just enough to visualize the MVP data and allow manual control. Focus on a couple of core elements:
A Concept List View showing current concepts in Prajna (maybe just list their IDs/names, usage count, and a snippet of their ledger info like parent or age). This can be backed by an API call to GET /ledger which in MVP simply dumps the internal ledger state (or a filtered view of active concepts).
A Metrics Display for key metrics (for MVP, maybe just show the current stale_concepts_ratio and reasoning_failures count that the engine is using). This can be polled from GET /metrics or even hardcoded if needed initially.
A Manual Evolution Trigger control – e.g., a button or switch in the UI that calls POST /evolve to force the orchestrator to run an evolution cycle. This allows testers to simulate the trigger without having to cause failures. Connect this to the backend: implement a basic /evolve endpoint that calls the orchestrator’s strategy function regardless of conditions (or perhaps sets a flag that conditions are bypassed).
Basic formatting and layout: use SvelteKit’s routing to maybe have a single-page app, or a couple of tabs (one for Prajna, one for ScholarSphere). For MVP, the ScholarSphere panel might be mostly placeholder (since archive-related actions might not yet be active), but include a static section showing “Ingest Mode: Auto” or similar for completeness.
Note: At this MVP stage, the UI doesn’t need to be pretty or fully featured – it’s a proof of concept. The main thing is that we can see the system state and send a command.
Integration of Components: Ensure that all pieces are connected: the orchestrator runs within Prajna’s process or alongside it (if separate thread or service, make sure it’s launched). The FastAPI backend knows about the orchestrator and ledger (perhaps import their modules or have them as singletons in memory). The SvelteKit front-end can talk to FastAPI (for simplicity in MVP, this might be on localhost without authentication). Resolve any CORS issues or routing needed to let the web app call the API.
Basic Guardrails in MVP: Even at MVP, include minimal safety checks. For example, wrap the orchestrator’s strategy execution in a try/catch and if any exception occurs, log it and do not propagate (ensuring a failed evolution attempt doesn’t crash Prajna). Also, perhaps limit the frequency of evolution: e.g., once triggered, disable further triggers for that session or a cooldown period, so we don’t end up in a rapid loop if something goes wrong. Hard-code this simple guard for now. And ensure that if manual trigger is pressed repeatedly it won’t queue multiple conflicting changes. Essentially, MVP guardrails are about preventing obvious failure modes while we test.
Architectural Interfaces: By end of Phase 1, the interfaces designed in Phase 0 should be partially implemented:
The FastAPI endpoints for at least GET /ledger and POST /evolve (and maybe GET /metrics) will be in place and documented with example requests.
The internal interface between Prajna and the orchestrator is functioning: e.g., Prajna calls DarwinGodelOrchestrator.check_and_evolve(metrics) at some point in its loop.
The ledger interface is being used by both Prajna and orchestrator as planned.
The UI–backend interface is proven through the working calls from the SvelteKit app.
While these interfaces might still be crude (e.g., the data returned might not have full fidelity or the API might not be final), we have effectively integrated the new modules into TORI’s architecture at a basic level. This sets the stage for adding more complexity in Phase 2. Validation Gates (Phase 1): We will test the MVP thoroughly in a controlled environment. The criteria to move to the next phase include:
Trigger Test: Manually simulate trigger conditions and verify the orchestrator responds correctly. For instance, we can feed dummy metric values to evolve_strategy_if (or use the manual UI button) to ensure the condition logic is working. If reasoning_failures is set high and stale_concepts_ratio high, does the engine indeed call the strategy? We might temporarily instrument the code to force a trigger and observe that a new concept was added to the mesh or a parameter changed. Passing this test means the core loop is functional.
Ledger Consistency Check: After some operations (queries answered, one evolution triggered, etc.), inspect the ψ‑LineageLedger contents. Validate that entries make sense (the new concept added by the strategy appears with the correct parent reference, usage counts increment after each query, etc.). Ensure that querying the ledger via the API returns data that matches what’s in memory. This ensures traceability is starting to work.
Dashboard Display Verification: Open the MVP dashboard in a browser and confirm it correctly displays information. For example, if a new concept was injected, it should appear in the concept list. If we press the manual evolve button, perhaps see some change or at least a confirmation message. The metrics displayed should correspond to what we know (e.g., if we artificially set reasoning_failures, the UI shows that count). This is to validate the UI-backend wiring. Also test basic interactivity: refresh the page, ensure it reconnects properly; try the controls in different order.
No Regression in QA Performance: Run a set of normal queries through TORI with the new MVP components active (but not triggering, ideally). The answers should remain correct and timely. Measure any latency overhead introduced by the checks and ledger logging – it should be minimal (logging to an in-memory structure is very fast). If there is any noticeable slowdown, we might need to optimize or flag it for Phase 2. The goal is that the end-user experience is unchanged in normal operation up to this point.
Stability: The system should run for some period with the MVP features on without crashing or memory leaks. We can do a soak test for a few hours where queries are continuously processed (if possible) and see that the ledger grows normally, the orchestrator doesn’t throw exceptions, etc. MVP is small-scale enough that issues are unlikely, but this gives confidence to proceed.
Team Acceptance: Demonstrate the MVP to the team (and possibly stakeholders). Show an example of an evolution event occurring and being logged/viewed. If the core concept is proven (even if the change it made was trivial), that’s a success for MVP. Gather any immediate feedback or concerns – for instance, the team might suggest additional metrics to include or adjustments in UI layout – and note these for the next phase. We should have buy-in that we’re ready to add sophistication in Phase 2.
Phase 2: Alpha Prototype (Feature Complete & Internal Testing)
Goals: Expand the prototype into a feature-complete alpha version of the self-evolving system. In this phase, we build out the full functionality of the Darwin-Gödel engine, ledger, and dashboard as envisioned, and we start rigorously testing the system in-house. The Alpha should include all major features: multiple trigger conditions, a variety of strategies (with scoring), comprehensive lineage tracking, and a rich interactive dashboard. We also introduce more robust guardrails to manage the increased complexity. By the end of Phase 2, TORI should be demonstrably self-improving in a controlled setting, with developers able to monitor and intervene via the dashboard. Technical Tasks:
Full Conditional Engine Implementation: Enhance the Darwin-Gödel Trigger Engine to handle a broader set of conditions and actions. This includes:
Implementing multiple predicate checks covering the range of cognitive conditions identified in Phase 0. For instance: low average answer confidence (could indicate a need for strategy change), high concept overlap entropy (the mesh has too many redundant concepts), or detection of a phase transition (if TORI’s context shifts domain, e.g., suddenly getting many queries in a new subject area, perhaps needing new knowledge infusion). Each condition can be represented as a function that returns true/false given the current metrics and context. The engine will evaluate these predicates in its loop. We may also allow composite conditions (logical AND/OR combinations) for more nuanced triggers

.
Meta-Strategy Selection: Instead of a single hardcoded response, implement a mechanism to choose among multiple strategies when an evolution is triggered. For example, maintain a list or registry of strategy functions (mutation, fission, recombination, knowledge-refresh, etc.) each with metadata on when it’s applicable. The engine can use a simple heuristic or scoring system to pick the best strategy given the context. (E.g., if the issue is concept overlap, choose a fission or pruning strategy; if the issue is knowledge gap, choose a synthetic concept generation or retrieval strategy.) This is akin to “breeding” strategies based on context

. We might weight the selection using parameters adjustable from the UI (the “Strategy Weighting” controls)

.
Strategy Execution & Validation: For each strategy, implement its logic in detail. Some examples:
Mutation Strategy: Adjust certain internal parameters in Prajna’s reasoning (e.g., tune a threshold for concept linking, or alter the prompt used by a language model component).
Fission Strategy: Identify a concept node that has many connections (overloaded concept) and algorithmically split it into two more specific concepts, reassigning connections (this would involve graph analysis and perhaps using an NLP model to rename or redefine the split concepts).
Recombination Strategy: Pick two low-use concepts and attempt to merge them or find a generalized concept that subsumes them, reducing complexity.
Knowledge Refresh: If a trigger indicates outdated knowledge, call a routine to query ScholarSphere or an external source for an update (e.g., find new facts to attach to an old concept, or mark it stale).
Self-Modification Strategy: At the more experimental end, allow the engine to suggest changes to its own code (e.g., generate a new method in reasoning_engine.py). This would be done carefully: using a code-generation model to draft a change, then storing it as a candidate rather than executing immediately. (We likely leave actual self-code-editing to a later safe test, not automatic in alpha without review, see guardrails below.)
For each strategy execution, implement a post-evaluation step. That is, after applying a change, measure its effect. This could involve running a predefined evaluation set of queries (a benchmark or regression tests) and comparing results to previous performance. For example, if we added a new concept, does answering accuracy on related questions improve? If we tweaked a parameter, do we see faster reasoning or fewer failures? This Meta-Evaluation Engine acts as a safeguard: it scores the outcome of the evolution and can decide to keep or revert the change

. For now, implement a simple version: maybe have a small set of test prompts and ensure no test fails worse than before, etc.
Reversion Mechanism: Build in the ability to undo or disable a strategy’s changes if the evaluation deems them harmful or not beneficial enough. This could mean storing a copy of the previous state (e.g., keep previous parameter values, or if a concept was removed maybe mark it inactive rather than deleting so it can be restored)

. In code changes, it could mean not merging the new code or keeping it in a separate branch file. The engine should log the decision (promote or revert) to the ledger or another audit log.
ψ‑LineageLedger Enhancements: Upgrade the ledger to be more comprehensive and robust:
Persistent Storage: Move from a simplistic storage to a more durable one. For instance, use a lightweight database (SQLite or TinyDB) or at least ensure the JSON is saved to disk after each update (with backups). This prevents losing the history if the system restarts. Handle concurrency if Prajna and ScholarSphere might write simultaneously (perhaps funnel all writes through a single ledger interface with a lock).
Complete Lifecycle Data: Expand what we store. Implement periodic updates to coherence scores: e.g., after each reasoning cycle, recompute each concept’s coherence (this could be as simple as checking how many different contexts it has appeared in – broad usage might indicate higher coherence). Also track emergence or phase data: for example, assign each concept a “ψ-phase” value representing which cognitive layer it’s in (maybe a numeric phase index like extracted (phase 1), synthesized (phase 2), abstract (phase 3), etc., if applicable). This could be used to highlight phase discrepancies between live and archive

.
Mutation Lineage Tracking: When strategies like fission or recombination create or modify concepts, carefully record these relationships. Possibly maintain a separate list of edges like (parent -> child) in mutations. This will directly feed the Concept Mutation Tree visualization. By alpha’s end, for any given concept we should be able to reconstruct its ancestry (chain of ideas it came from) and descendants, which may branch
sakana.ai
. For instance, if concept C was split into C1 and C2, the ledger might mark C as “split_into: [C1, C2]” and each of C1, C2 has “origin: split from C”.
Failure and Aging Flags: Implement automatic flagging in the ledger: e.g., if a concept hasn’t been used in N days or N queries, set a flag stale=true. If a concept has been part of an answer that was marked incorrect or caused the assistant to falter, increment a failure counter for that concept; if above a threshold, mark failing=true. These flags inform the evolution engine (e.g., a failing concept might be targeted for revision or removal)

.
Query Interface: Improve the programmatic interface to the ledger. For example, support queries like ledger.find_stale_concepts() or ledger.get_top_concepts(by="coherence", limit=10) to retrieve data easily for either the engine or the dashboard. This could also include an API endpoint if needed (though it might be internal to the backend).
Dashboard Functionality Completion: Build out the dashboard to realize the full design from Phase 0:
Real-time Graph Visualization: Integrate Cytoscape.js or D3.js to display the live ConceptMesh. For performance, you might not show all nodes if too many; possibly focus on key nodes or allow the user to filter. Use visual cues (color, size) to indicate properties (e.g., stale concepts in red, newly added concepts highlighted, high-coherence concepts larger node, etc.). Provide controls to toggle layers (maybe show/hide archived concepts or different ψ-phases). The Mesh Entropy indicator can be a part of this graph display (e.g., overall graph connectivity or redundancy measure shown as a number or gauge)

.
7D Metrics Charts: Using a charting library, implement an area or line chart that updates over time for metrics like “awareness, coherence, emergence, novelty, accuracy, stability, utilization” (hypothetical 7 dimensions). These might be derived from internal metrics (coherence could be average concept coherence, emergence could be rate of new concept introduction, etc.). The chart should update live (via WebSocket events or by polling every few seconds) to show trends.
Strategy Replay & Controls: Create a timeline view that shows a sequence of evolution events. Each event (from the ledger or orchestrator log) would appear with a timestamp and a label (e.g., “Mutation strategy applied: split concept X into X1, X2”). If clicked, it could show details like before/after metrics. Implement UI controls to step through or filter these events. Additionally, provide UI elements for Strategy configuration: for example, a dropdown or list of strategies with toggles to enable/disable certain strategies (if we want to quickly test with some strategies off), or sliders as designed to weight their selection probabilities

. This should tie into the orchestrator’s logic (e.g., if weight for “mutation” is set to 0, skip that strategy).
Concept Lineage Browser: Implement the Concept Mutation Tree visualization. A UI approach could be: the user selects a concept (from a list or by clicking a node in the graph), then a sidebar or modal shows its lineage tree (perhaps using a tree layout or just text indentation). Alternatively, use Cytoscape to display a subgraph of the lineage. Show parent -> child links and annotate with the type of mutation (e.g., “C1 -> C2 (split)”). This leverages the data recorded in the ledger. It allows an engineer to trace how an idea evolved, which is crucial for audit and understanding emergent knowledge.
Alerts and Notifications: Implement the alert system – define thresholds for warnings (some might be the same as trigger conditions, e.g., if mesh entropy goes above a certain value, trigger a “Mesh instability” warning in the UI; or if no new concept has been added in a long time and questions accuracy is dropping, a “stagnation” warning). Technically, this could be done by having the backend push an alert event when a predicate is true but perhaps conditions not severe enough to trigger an evolution. Or simply evaluate continuously and if any health metric is in the red zone, display a colored warning icon on the dashboard. Ensure that these alerts are clearly visible and have some info for next steps (like suggesting to trigger an evolution or check a particular panel).
Manual Control Expansion: In addition to the manual “trigger evolution” button, by alpha we might add manual controls for specific actions: e.g., a button to “Inject Synthetic Concept” (perhaps opening a small form where a user can type a concept to add or pick two concepts to merge manually), or a button to “Run Alignment Check” (force a sync between ScholarSphere and Prajna if needed). Essentially, give power users the ability to guide the evolution if they choose, which is useful during testing.
Polish UI/UX: While it’s still an internal alpha, ensure the UI is reasonably organized and labeled. Provide tooltips or help text for the various controls (especially for any jargon like “ψ-phase” – explain it in the interface for clarity). This will help new team members or testers to understand what they are seeing.
Advanced Guardrails and Safety: With full capabilities active, we must enforce robust guardrails:
Sandboxed Testing of High-Risk Changes: Contrary to the final aim of ditching sandboxes, during alpha we should simulate sandbox testing for the more dangerous evolutions (like code self-rewrite). For instance, implement the orchestrator such that if a strategy suggests modifying code or something radical, it doesn’t apply directly to the live system. Instead, it could spin up a sandbox environment (maybe a subprocess or a separate instance of Prajna loaded in memory) where the change is applied and tested with some inputs

. This was recommended earlier as a safety step

. If the sandbox test passes (the new version performs well on benchmarks), then merge the change into the live instance (perhaps still under a feature flag). This approach can be gradually relaxed later, but for alpha it prevents catastrophic self-modifications.
Meta-Evaluation Engine: As mentioned, have a systematic way to evaluate each evolution. Implement this as a module that runs a suite of tests (like a mini regression suite) whenever the orchestrator makes a change. If any critical test fails or metrics dip, automatically revert the change and log a “revert event” (which can also appear on the timeline with a red marker perhaps). Conversely, if improvements are confirmed, log a “promotion event” (maybe green marker). This ensures empirical validation of each self-improvement, similar to how DGM “empirically validates each change using benchmarks”

.
Rate Limiting and Access Control: Ensure the system doesn’t evolve too frequently or without oversight. Implement a rate limit on automatic evolutions (e.g., at most one per hour or per N queries) unless manually overridden. This prevents rapid oscillations and gives engineers time to observe effects. Also, integrate some access control: e.g., require a special flag or mode to be enabled for auto-evolution to run. In testing, we might run in “auto-evolve mode” freely, but before production, we might want the default to be manual approval mode. The dashboard could have a master toggle “Evolution: Automatic / Manual”. In Alpha, we likely keep it manual or semi-auto while we gain confidence.
Logging and Monitoring: Enhance logging around all evolution activities. Every time a predicate triggers, log which one and what metrics caused it (transparency). Log when a strategy is chosen and the rationale if possible. Also log the outcome of the evaluation. These logs will be invaluable for debugging. Consider also integrating with a monitoring system (if available) to catch anomalies (e.g., if CPU or memory usage spikes due to a new strategy, flag it).
Alignment Checks: Begin to incorporate checks for alignment and safety in the content sense. For example, if a strategy involves using a language model to generate new code or concepts, ensure the prompt and instructions include guidance to maintain alignment (not to produce harmful instructions, etc.). If the system is to be self-improving, it should also not degrade its ethical boundaries. This might involve running new answers or behaviors through an audit filter or having an external checker verify that the self-modification didn’t introduce policy violations. While this is a broad area, start with simple rules: e.g., if an evolution changes something about how answers are generated, run a set of content tests (like checking that it doesn’t suddenly allow disallowed content).
Interface Refinements: With the expanded functionality, update interface definitions accordingly:
Expand the API endpoints as needed: e.g., GET /concept/{id}/lineage (returns the lineage subtree for that concept), GET /evolutions (list recent evolution events and their status), POST /strategy/{name}/run (to manually invoke a specific strategy, if we allow that via UI).
If WebSocket is used, define specific event message structures (like an {"event":"concept_added", "data":{...}} format, etc.) and ensure the front-end is in sync with that.
Update documentation for interfaces so that if other developers or tools want to query the state (for example, maybe a CLI tool to query a concept’s status), they can use these APIs.
Make sure that any changes to existing interfaces (if any) are backward-compatible or clearly communicated (though since this is mostly new functionality, it might not affect external users yet).
Validation Gates (Phase 2 – Alpha Testing): This phase will involve intensive internal testing and iterative improvement. Criteria to move to a production rollout include:
Comprehensive Functional Testing: Verify each feature implemented:
Trigger each type of predicate in a controlled way and ensure the correct strategy fires. We might create specific scenarios or even dummy functions to simulate conditions (for example, simulate a knowledge gap scenario and see if the knowledge-refresh strategy triggers).
Test each strategy’s effect: For instance, if a fission strategy runs, check the concept graph after to confirm one node became two and connections are adjusted; run queries that involve that concept to see if answers improve or remain correct. If a self-modify (code change) strategy is tested in sandbox, verify that the sandbox doesn’t crash and that the new code passes tests. This likely requires a set of automated tests for TORI’s Q&A accuracy and system health that we run after each evolution.
Ensure the ledger correctly captures all events: create a complex sequence (e.g., concept A mutated to B, B and C merged to D, D archived) and then use the ledger queries to reconstruct that sequence, verifying it matches expectation. Essentially, do an audit trial using the ledger to confirm it’s logging everything needed.
UI Testing: Use the dashboard extensively. Does the graph update in real time when new concepts are added or removed? Do the charts reflect the underlying data accurately? Test all controls: adjusting a slider for strategy weighting should internally change the behavior (we can perhaps see the difference in which strategies get picked). Try out the alert system by forcing an alert condition to see if the UI shows it. Also test on different browsers and screen sizes if applicable, to ensure it’s accessible for the team. Gather feedback on usability – since this is for internal use, it doesn’t have to be perfect, but clarity is key.
Performance and Load Testing: With more features running, assess the performance. Monitor CPU and memory usage of TORI during heavy query loads with evolution enabled. The concept graph visualization might be heavy if there are many nodes – test how many concepts the system can handle before the UI or backend slows down. Also measure any latency added per query by the checks and logging. If the checks are too slow (e.g., calculating complex coherence metrics each time), consider optimizing or doing them asynchronously (maybe in a background thread rather than blocking the answer response). Ideally, answering a question should still be real-time, with the evolution engine doing work in parallel or during idle times. If needed, mark certain enhancements for optimization in Phase 3.
Stability and Chaos Testing: Run the system for extended periods in an environment simulating real usage. Possibly enable auto-evolution and let it handle a random stream of queries for hours or days. Observe whether it remains stable (no crashes, no runaway growth of concepts or infinite loops). Test edge cases: what if two triggers fire at nearly the same time? (Make sure the engine handles sequentially or queues them.) What if the evaluation finds a bad change – does the revert happen cleanly without leaving partial state? Induce failures intentionally (e.g., make a strategy throw an exception) to test the robustness of error handling.
Guardrail Efficacy: Deliberately attempt some “unsafe” evolutions in a controlled way to see if guardrails catch them. For example, if we try letting the system modify a core function incorrectly, does the sandbox test catch the issue and prevent it going live? If we remove a frequently used concept, does the system recover or realize the mistake (maybe through failing tests and then restoring it)? Essentially, validate that the safety net (meta-evaluation + manual oversight) would catch major problems. If any guardrail seems weak, reinforce it now.
User (Team) Feedback: Have the internal team (or a small set of beta users if appropriate) use the alpha system for actual tasks. Collect feedback on whether the self-improvements are making a positive difference. For instance, do they notice answers getting better over time on their own? Is the dashboard helpful in understanding what the system is doing? Any confusion or suggestions? This qualitative feedback is important to fine-tune the system before wider release.
Documentation Update: By this stage, update all documentation to reflect the new system. This includes inline code documentation (so future devs understand this complex system), an updated architecture diagram showing how Prajna, ScholarSphere, Orchestrator, Ledger, Dashboard interact, and a user guide for the dashboard. The documentation is also a validation artifact: the team should review it to ensure it matches reality and is clear.
If all tests and reviews are satisfactory – i.e., the system is stable, improvements are evident, and the team is confident – we can proceed to production rollout. If there are issues, address them and possibly have another round of internal testing until ready.
Phase 3: Production Deployment and Refinement
Goals: Transition the self-evolving TORI system from an experimental alpha into a production-ready platform. This involves hardening the system, optimizing performance, instituting ongoing monitoring, and ensuring all safety measures and user requirements are met. In production, TORI should reliably use its Darwin-Gödel engine to improve itself in real-time, with the ψ‑LineageLedger providing accountability for every concept, and the dashboard supporting operations and oversight. The goal is a smooth deployment where the new capabilities run continuously and deliver measurable improvements to TORI’s performance over time. Technical Tasks:
Performance Tuning: Optimize any components identified as bottlenecks in testing. For example, if ledger writes were slowing things down, switch to batch or async writes. If the concept graph becomes large, maybe implement pruning of truly unused concepts (with confirmation from an engineer) to keep the mesh manageable. Optimize the predicate evaluations – possibly move expensive checks to run less frequently or on a schedule (e.g., a heavy coherence recalculation might run every hour rather than every query). Ensure that the added overhead of the evolution engine is negligible for normal operations. Also, optimize the SvelteKit app for production (minify assets, etc.).
Scalability and Robustness: Consider if the architecture needs scaling for more load. If TORI expects a high query volume, we might isolate the evolution engine to its own process or thread pool, so that if it’s busy evaluating a new strategy, it doesn’t block answering queries. Potentially use a task queue for long-running evolution tasks (so queries can continue in parallel). Ensure the system can handle simultaneous user sessions on the dashboard if multiple engineers use it. Use production-ready infrastructure for the dashboard (perhaps deploy it behind authentication, on a secure domain, etc.). Set up database for the ledger if the JSON approach might not scale (especially if the concept count grows or if we want robust querying). A small SQL or NoSQL DB could be introduced now that the design is proven.
Complete Guardrails & Policies: Finalize the governance rules for self-evolution in production. For instance, decide if auto-evolution will be fully enabled or if it will run in a limited mode initially. Possibly implement a policy that certain high-impact strategies (like actual code modifications) still require a human review via the dashboard – i.e., the engine can prepare a change and mark it for review, and an engineer can approve it on the dashboard (the UI could present a diff or summary of the proposed change). This hybrid approach ensures safety until we trust full automation. Clearly mark in the code/config which mode is active (so it’s easy to toggle if needed).
Logging, Monitoring, and Alerts in Prod: Integrate with production monitoring tools. For example, set up logs for evolution events to feed into a logging service (Splunk, ELK, etc.) and define alerts: if more than X evolutions happen in a day, alert (could indicate oscillation), or if an evolution fails (reverted) repeatedly, alert (system might be stuck). Also monitor answer quality metrics over time to ensure the self-changes are positive. Possibly maintain a dashboard panel for key performance indicators (e.g., answer accuracy on a validation set) so that any dip can be spotted and linked to a self-change event.
Security Audit: Since the system now has new capabilities (especially running self-generated code), do a thorough security review. Ensure that any code generation is sandboxed or reviewed so it cannot introduce vulnerabilities. The FastAPI endpoints and the dashboard should be secured (use authentication tokens or an internal network if it’s an internal tool). Check that no sensitive information from the archive or memory can leak through the UI unintentionally. If the system connects to external resources (maybe to fetch knowledge), ensure those interactions are properly sanitized and rate-limited to prevent abuse.
Data Management: Plan for how to handle the accumulation of data (concepts and ledger entries) over the long term. For example, if TORI runs for months, the ledger will grow. Implement a retention or archiving policy: maybe archive older parts of the lineage (e.g., concepts long archived and not used can be moved to a deeper archive or compressed summary). Also ensure we have backups of the ledger and any learned strategies, so we don’t lose the “knowledge of how to improve” in case of a failure.
User Training & Handoff: Prepare any documentation or training needed for the operations team or end-users (if, say, this system is handed to another team or used by clients). Even if the dashboard is internal, write a user guide explaining how to use it to monitor the system, what each control does, and how to respond to alerts. This might include a troubleshooting guide: e.g., “If the system issues an alert of type X, consider taking action Y or consult a developer.” Essentially, make sure that if the original developers move on, others can manage this evolving system confidently.
Finalize UI/UX: Do a last pass on the dashboard to improve usability for production. Remove any dev-only features or debug info that was present in alpha. Make sure the interface is clean and focused on what operators need. Possibly integrate feedback from alpha users to simplify certain panels or add a requested feature (for example, maybe an export button to download the lineage data as a report, etc.). Ensure the UI works in the production environment URL and that any needed environment configuration (like API base URL) is correctly set.
Launch Strategy: Plan the rollout strategy. It might be wise to do a soft launch: run the new system in parallel with the old (if possible) or at least enable auto-evolution gradually. One approach: initially run in a monitoring-only mode in production – the engine triggers and logs suggestions but doesn’t actually change anything without approval. Observe this for some time to build trust (did it suggest sensible improvements?). Then progressively allow it to execute changes automatically for low-risk strategies and keep high-risk ones manual. Over time, as confidence grows, expand automation. This phased rollout in production mitigates risk.
Measure Outcomes: Define what success means in production. Identify key metrics like answer accuracy, user satisfaction, or efficiency that should improve with self-evolution. Set up mechanisms to measure these continuously (A/B tests or comparing periods with evolution on vs off). This will validate that TORI’s reflexive improvements are delivering real value. If possible, compile results after launch – e.g., “the system’s correct answer rate improved from 85% to 88% after one week of self-evolution, and continued to climb thereafter.” These insights can be used to further tune the system and also to communicate the success of the project.
Architectural Interfaces (Production-Ready): At this final stage, all interfaces should be well-defined, stable, and documented. The recommended architecture solidifies as: a modular system with clear separation between the core reasoning (Prajna), the meta-reasoning (Darwin-Gödel engine), the memory (ScholarSphere + LineageLedger), and the UI. The interface APIs – such as the evolution engine’s hooks and the dashboard’s endpoints – should remain consistent now to support maintenance. We expect to finalize the API documentation and perhaps even set up automated API tests to ensure they remain stable. If any additional interfaces were needed for ops (like an admin API to turn evolution on/off), those are implemented and documented. We also ensure that the data schema for ψ‑LineageLedger is finalized and perhaps versioned. If any changes were made during alpha (e.g., adding new fields), update the schema doc and consider writing a migration script if needed to upgrade any saved data. In production, the schema must remain backward-compatible if we deploy updates. Validation Gates (Phase 3 – Production readiness): Before and during the production rollout, the following must be checked off:
Final Regression Testing: Run the full test suite one more time on the production build. This includes all Q&A regression tests (to ensure the system still answers existing queries correctly), performance tests under high load, and any integration tests for the new APIs. Everything should pass at this stage.
Security Clearance: All security tests and audits must be passed. For instance, run static code analysis on the self-modifying parts to catch any obvious issues, ensure dependencies (like SvelteKit libraries) are up to date with no known vulnerabilities, and that environment secrets (if any) are handled properly. Sign-off from a security officer or equivalent is ideal.
Stakeholder Sign-off: Present the outcomes of the alpha phase and readiness state to stakeholders or leadership. They should understand how the new self-evolution works, see the safety mechanisms in place, and agree on enabling it in production. If there are any concerns (like legal/compliance issues with an AI modifying itself), address them now (for example, logging all changes for audit might be a requirement – which our ledger provides).
Launch and Monitoring: When first enabling in production, do so during a period where the team is available to watch the system. Verify that the initial triggers and evolutions occur as expected (or if in cautious mode, that they log suggestions). Essentially, treat the early production period as an extended test – closely watch logs, system metrics, and the dashboard. This validation is ongoing: the system itself will be providing feedback (via the dashboard and alerts) – use that to ensure it’s functioning normally. If any anomaly is detected, be ready to pause the evolution engine (for instance, flip the system to manual mode from the dashboard) and fix forward.
Continuous Improvement Loop: Finally, set up a review cycle post-launch. For example, after one month of operation, review the ψ‑LineageLedger data and system performance with the team. See what kinds of evolutions happened, which were most effective, and if any patterns of failure emerged. Use this to refine the logical predicates or add new strategies in future iterations. Even though this is beyond initial production, it’s an important part of validating that the system truly learns to improve in a sustainable way.
Once the system is live and stable, TORI will effectively function as a living, self-evolving epistemic ecology

. It will continuously assimilate knowledge, refine its reasoning strategies, and adapt to new challenges – all while keeping a record of every change and allowing human insight and control through the interactive dashboard. By following this phased plan, we ensure that this transformation is executed with discipline: each phase builds on a solid foundation of tested features and addresses potential risks early, leading to a production system that is both innovative and reliable.
Summary of Deliverables by Phase

Alpha Phase: Fully functional Darwin-Gödel Engine (multiple strategies, conditional logic, and evaluation), comprehensive ψ‑LineageLedger tracking concept lineage and health

, feature-rich SvelteKit dashboard (graph visualization, controls, timelines)

, plus robust guardrails (reversion, rate-limit, sandbox test for risky changes). Internal testing shows self-improvements and system stability.
Production Phase: Optimized and secured system deployed to live environment. All modules (Prajna, ScholarSphere, Orchestrator, Ledger, Dashboard) integrated and operating within set safety bounds. Monitoring and documentation in place for ongoing maintenance. APIs and data structures finalized for collaboration and future development.
By adhering to this phased roadmap, the team will collaboratively build TORI’s next evolution – endowing it with the capacity to learn from its own learning process and continuously refine itself. This ensures TORI remains at the cutting edge of AI: not just a static system, but one that grows in capability autonomously, under careful logical control and human guidance. The result is an AI that can truly adapt and improve perpetually, with full transparency and accountability for every step of its evolution. Sources:
