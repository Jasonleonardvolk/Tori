Physics-Inspired Models for a Phase-Field Resonance Cognitive Architecture (TORI)
Introduction
TORI is a proposed cognitive architecture that departs from discrete, database-style memory in favor of a continuous field-based memory with resonance dynamics. Instead of storing and retrieving vectors by index, TORI would encode knowledge as patterns in physical fields (phases, waves, topological states), preserving context holographically and decaying or reinforcing information in ways analogous to natural processes. Building such a system draws on deep principles across physics – from quantum entanglement and field theory to thermodynamics, general relativity, and wave dynamics. In this survey, we explore theoretical and experimental models from physics that could ground TORI’s design, including: phase-field models of memory, quantum entanglement as associative links, entropy-driven diffusion for forgetting, resonance and oscillation for binding, topologically protected representations for robustness, and field-theoretic/wave-based computation as an alternative to vector-search. We present key equations, models, and simulation frameworks from these domains, highlighting how they might be adapted to implement a continuous, holographic, context-preserving memory and inference system at scale.
Phase-Field Memory Systems
In physics, a “phase field” refers to a continuous field variable (often denoted $\phi(\mathbf{x},t)$) whose value represents the local phase or state of a system. Phase-field models have been used to describe material microstructures (e.g. mixtures of solid phases, magnetic domains) and can exhibit multiple stable states that coexist separated by domain walls. This suggests a memory mechanism: information could be stored in the spatial pattern of phases (analogous to how ferromagnetic domains store bits). For example, a simple Landau free energy with a double-well potential $V(\phi)=a,\phi^2 + b,\phi^4$ yields two stable phases ($\phi\approx \pm\phi_0$). Bits of memory can be encoded by regions of $\phi \approx +\phi_0$ versus $\phi \approx -\phi_0$, with domain walls preserving the pattern until sufficient energy is applied to switch phases. Indeed, phase-change memory (PCM) technology already uses a material’s phase to store data: chalcogenide glass cells are electrically heated to switch between amorphous and crystalline states, encoding binary 0/1 in the material’s phase

. Each cell’s phase is non-volatile, providing persistent storage by physical state. Extending this concept, one can imagine a distributed phase-field memory: a whole medium whose phase pattern encodes a complex data structure or “map” of knowledge. In such a medium, associative content-addressable recall could be achieved by exploiting interference and phase relationships. Notably, holographic associative memory (HAM) models use the phase orientation of complex numbers to map and retrieve information
en.wikipedia.org
. In HAM (which mimics optical holography), any stored item is represented by a wave pattern, and the phase of each component carries information; queries are performed by wave interference instead of index lookup
en.wikipedia.org
. Each piece of an interference pattern can be used to retrieve its complement – much like a reference laser beam reconstructs an image from a hologram
en.wikipedia.org
. This phase-oriented storage is inherently contextual – the memory is distributed over the field, and partial inputs produce a whole associated output. The governing equations for a phase-field memory might resemble the Cahn-Hilliard or Allen–Cahn equations, which describe how a field with multiple potential wells evolves over time under diffusion and local energy forces. For example, one could define a free energy functional $F[\phi] = \int dV,[\frac{\kappa}{2}|\nabla\phi|^2 + V(\phi)]$, and derive memory dynamics $\partial_t \phi = -L,\frac{\delta F}{\delta \phi}$ (a Ginzburg–Landau relaxation). This would naturally produce pattern formation and metastable phase configurations that could serve as memory traces. Simulation frameworks for phase-field models (such as Fenics, MOOSE, or custom GPU solvers) can evolve such equations for large systems, allowing us to experiment with writing, erasing, and propagating “memories” as field configurations. The phase-field approach aligns with TORI’s goal of non-discrete memory: information isn’t stored in indexed slots, but in the holistic pattern of a field, potentially allowing superposition and smooth blending of memories (much like overlapping holograms or analog neural fields). Importantly, any operation to retrieve or update memory would involve field interactions (waves, soliton movements, etc.) rather than pointer lookups – a paradigm shift from classical databases.
Quantum Entanglement as Persistent Associative Memory
Quantum mechanics offers a striking principle for linking information: entanglement. When two quanta become entangled, their states are correlated such that measuring one instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of distance. In a sense, entangled systems share information nonlocally – they hold a persistent association. This has led some theorists to interpret entanglement as a kind of memory woven between particles: a record of their joint history that manifests as synchronized states
researchgate.net
researchgate.net
. Indeed, one can view entangled pairs (like the Bell state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0_A 1_B\rangle + |1_A 0_B\rangle)$) as storing one bit of shared information – if particle A is found in state 0, particle B must be in 1, and vice versa. Rather than a signal being sent, the outcome reflects a pre-existing correlation, essentially a memorized link between the two qubits. In a cognitive architecture, one might exploit this by encoding concepts or percepts into entangled states such that retrieving one element (measuring or interacting with one part of the system) instantaneously yields its associates as outcomes in another part. This is highly speculative for a large-scale system, but quantum associative memory models provide a concrete starting point. Researchers have developed quantum Hopfield networks and associative memory algorithms that use superposition and entanglement to store and recall patterns with potentially exponential capacity gains
nature.com
. For example, a Quantum Hopfield Associative Memory (QHAM) can be implemented on a quantum computer by representing neurons as qubits and encoding the weight matrix into a sequence of quantum gates
nature.com
. The network’s attractor states (memories) become energy minima in a quantum energy landscape, similar to classical Hopfield nets but enriched by quantum effects. Entanglement in these models correlates qubit states during recall so that a partial or noisy input state collapses toward a stored pattern across the entire entangled network. Experimental progress is underway: small QHAMs have been demonstrated on IBM quantum processors, showing that entangled qubits can indeed retrieve an associated pattern after a few iterative updates
nature.com
. Another angle is quantum memory devices used in quantum communication – e.g. entangled photon memories in crystals or cold atoms – which store quantum states for extended times. These devices illustrate that entangled states can be made persistent and retrievable on-demand, akin to cache memory for quantum information
link.aps.org
phys.org
. While decoherence is a major challenge (entangled links are fragile when exposed to environment noise), techniques like error-correcting codes and topological qubits (see below) aim to protect entanglement. The mathematics describing entangled memory would involve the density matrix or wavefunction of the whole system rather than individual components. For instance, an associative memory might be a state $|\Psi_{\text{mem}}\rangle$ that encodes many linked item pairs $(A_i, B_i)$ in superposition. Querying $A_i$ (a measurement or partial projection) would cause $B_i$ to collapse into the correlated state – effectively recalling the associate. Simulation frameworks for open quantum systems (using tools like QuTiP or custom variational algorithms) could simulate small-scale versions of this process, to study how stable “associative entangled states” might form, persist, or fail under decoherence. If TORI were to leverage entanglement, it could mean building a planetary-scale quantum network of entangled nodes – a daunting task, but conceptually this network would hold associative links as physical entangled qubits, enabling extremely fast recall (instantaneous correlations) across vast distances. Early steps toward this exist: scientists have entangled memory nodes over 12.5 km of fiber
phys.org
, hinting at future quantum memory networks. In summary, quantum entanglement provides a model for content-addressable memory where association is not mediated by a search through an index, but by intrinsic correlations in a joint quantum state. The challenge is that scaling this to useful cognitive architectures requires robust entanglement across many degrees of freedom – motivating the use of topologically protected states and error-corrected qubits, discussed later.
Entropy-Based Concept Diffusion and Relevance Decay
Any memory system that isn’t actively maintained will eventually “forget” – in physics terms, ordered information tends to disperse and get lost amidst noise if energy isn’t expended to preserve it. Entropy provides the quantitative measure of this diffusion of information. In thermodynamics, entropy increase corresponds to the system’s microstates becoming more homogeneous or randomized. By analogy, concepts in a memory network can diffuse and lose distinctiveness over time – their “sharpness” decays, reflecting a rise in entropy of the information representation. A vivid way to express this: “Memory decays if not actively reinforced, as entropy erases the distinctions between stored information and random noise.”
watchsound.medium.com
. In other words, maintaining a memory is an active battle against entropy, requiring work (energy input) to continually refresh or stabilize the information structure
watchsound.medium.com
. The second law of thermodynamics guarantees that any isolated system will drift toward maximal entropy (minimal information). For a cognitive architecture like TORI, this implies that without mechanisms for rehearsal or error correction, stored knowledge would gradually blend into statistical noise – relevance of older or unused concepts would exponentially decay (much as an excited state in a physical system relaxes over time). We can model this process with equations analogous to diffusion or thermal decay. For example, if $c(t)$ represents the “activation” or relevance of a concept over time $t$ (in the absence of reinforcement), we might see $c(t)$ follow an exponential decay $c(t) = c(0),e^{-t/\tau}$, where $\tau$ is a characteristic memory time (this mirrors the concept of memory kernel decay in thermodynamic systems, where correlations often decay exponentially in time
sciencedirect.com
). In a spatially extended memory field, one could use a diffusion equation: $\partial_t \rho(\mathbf{x},t) = D,\nabla^2 \rho - \alpha \rho$, where $\rho(\mathbf{x},t)$ might be the “concentration” of a concept or memory trace at location $\mathbf{x}$ (in a semantic or feature space), $D$ is a diffusion coefficient causing the concept to spread out (becoming more general and less specific), and $\alpha$ is a decay rate. This equation would cause any localized concept representation to spread (diffuse) and diminish in amplitude over time – a mathematical realization of “concept drift” or forgetting. Such diffusion could also represent contextual blending: if two concepts are stored in overlapping regions of a field, over time their features might intermingle, analogous to mixing of fluids (unless some active mechanism keeps them separated, like an energy barrier). On the flip side, thermodynamics also teaches us that driving a system away from equilibrium (low entropy) can create structure. Nonlinear open systems (far from equilibrium) can develop dissipative structures – stable patterns sustained by continuous energy flow (e.g. Bénard convection cells). In a cognitive sense, this suggests that maintaining organized knowledge requires continual updates or energy input. TORI could incorporate an “attention” mechanism that injects energy (in the form of reactivation signals or phase resets) to refresh important memories, much like the brain uses metabolic energy to re-stabilize synaptic connections. The entropy perspective also yields measures to guide memory allocation: one could define an “information entropy” $S = -\sum_i p_i \ln p_i$ over concept usage probabilities to quantify how diffuse the system’s attention or memory is. Perhaps TORI could monitor this entropy and apply active measures (simulations of rehearsal or consolidation) when entropy grows too high (indicating memories are becoming too uniform or lost). Empirically, the idea that past low-entropy states create enduring records is supported by our physical world: we have abundant traces of the past (geological strata, fossils, photographs) because the early universe was low-entropy, enabling records to form and persist
mdpi.com
. Carlo Rovelli has derived that any stable memory must ultimately be founded on an entropy gradient between system and environment
mdpi.com
mdpi.com
. In practical simulations, one could implement concept diffusion using random walk algorithms on a graph of concepts or by adding Gaussian noise and blurring to vector representations over time, then counteracting it with periodic “sharpening” (analogous to error correction). This would mimic how, without rehearsal, human memories gradually fade or generalize (increasing uncertainty), but targeted review can re-impose structure (lower the entropy of that memory trace). In summary, entropy provides both a warning and a design principle: any long-lived cognitive architecture needs a strategy to combat entropy (through active maintenance or clever encoding), and modeling concept relevance as a diffusive, decaying process can inform how TORI might implement gradual forgetting or context-dependent memory decay in a physics-consistent way.
Resonance and Oscillator Networks for Concept Binding
One of the most intriguing ideas from neuroscience is that the brain may solve the “binding problem” (how disparate features unite into one percept) through synchronous oscillations. Neurons oscillating in phase at e.g. gamma frequency (30–80 Hz) can transiently form a coalition representing a single percept or concept – this is the binding-by-synchrony hypothesis
en.wikipedia.org
. Simply put, when neurons fire in a coordinated rhythm, their activity is dynamically bound together; features that oscillate together are perceived together. TORI’s architecture can draw from this principle by using resonant networks of oscillators to bind and represent concepts. Instead of discrete symbol pointers, a concept could be an emergent sync pattern across a network of coupled oscillators (electrical, optical, mechanical, or abstract mathematical oscillators). When a new compound concept forms from parts, the oscillators representing those parts could lock phase or frequency, effectively “wiring” them together for the duration of the resonance. This approach has strong support in computational neuroscience and physics. Oscillator networks have been extensively studied as models of neural computation. For example, Hoppensteadt and Izhikevich (among others) proposed networks of phase-coupled oscillators as an alternative to Hopfield neural nets, where stored memories correspond to phase-locked states of the oscillators
chaos1.la.asu.edu
chaos1.la.asu.edu
. In these oscillatory associative memory models, each neuron is a limit-cycle oscillator rather than a binary unit; patterns are encoded in the target phase differences between oscillators. A stored memory is essentially a phase configuration ${\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_N}$ that is stable under the coupling dynamics. The remarkable finding is that with appropriate coupling (e.g. a mix of first and second harmonic sinusoidal coupling terms), such networks can retrieve patterns with error-free perfection and high capacity by converging to the correct phase-locking

chaos1.la.asu.edu
) so that the desired phase alignments are attractors of the dynamics. Notably, one advantage of this model is hardware realizability: any physical oscillator can in principle serve as a “neuron.” Researchers have demonstrated that oscillatory memory networks could be built from electronic phase-locked loops, laser oscillators, or MEMS vibrators
chaos1.la.asu.edu
. For example, laser-based oscillators can naturally synchronize via optical coupling; the startup phases of lasers could encode a pattern, and through injection locking or interferometric coupling, an associative recall could be performed at light-speed. A prominent real-world example is the Coherent Ising Machine, where an array of optical parametric oscillators all resonate and adjust their relative phases to find the ground state of an Ising-spin optimization problem. This is analogous to an associative memory finding the best matching pattern for a given input – effectively doing a computation by wave harmony rather than step-by-step logic. The coherence among oscillators in such systems mirrors how resonance in TORI would bind concepts: if two features or ideas must be unified, the system could drive the corresponding oscillators into a common frequency or phase relation (a simple example: phase difference zero means “belong together,” difference $\pi$ means “opposite”, etc.). Oscillation can also support multi-modal integration – because frequency multiplexing allows different streams to coexist without confusion. In the brain, there is evidence that distinct frequency bands carry different content streams (e.g. theta for sequences, gamma for features). TORI might leverage a similar scheme: using different resonance modes for different types of content or hierarchical binding (small oscillation clusters for low-level features, nested into slower oscillations for higher-level groupings). The math of coupled oscillators also provides tools for stability analysis (via Lyapunov functions or energy functions in phase space), ensuring that bound states are attractors. Furthermore, resonance offers fast dynamic binding/unbinding – oscillators can sync or desync in a few cycles, potentially enabling real-time reorganization of memory links in a way that a static database pointer structure cannot easily emulate. As a concrete example, consider two memory items that should be associated in context: if their corresponding oscillators receive a common excitation or are coupled through a third “bridge” oscillator, they may phase-lock (resonate) together, thereby encoding an associative link. If context changes, that coupling can diminish and the oscillators fall out of sync, effectively ungrouping the concept – in essence, implementing context-dependent binding through tunable resonance. From a simulation standpoint, frameworks for solving large oscillator network dynamics (custom ODE integrators, or physics simulators for coupled pendulums, Josephson junction arrays, etc.) can be employed to test these ideas. We can simulate, for example, a network of 1000 oscillators with random initial phases and show that if the coupling matrix encodes a set of patterns, the network will spontaneously partition into synchronized clusters corresponding to those patterns – retrieving them if a stimulus nudges the phases toward one cluster. In summary, resonance-based binding provides a powerful, biologically plausible, and physically realizable means of dynamic memory encoding. It allows TORI to bind features into concepts via phase synchronization, achieving what vector databases do (group related features) but in a fluid, on-the-fly manner using the physics of oscillatory coherence instead of static data structures

Topologically Protected State Representations
A major challenge for any large-scale memory system is robustness: how to protect stored information from noise, errors, or damage. Here, topology – the mathematics of shape and invariants – offers inspiration. In physics, certain states are topologically protected, meaning they cannot be continuously deformed into a trivial state without a phase transition or large energy input. A classic example is the magnetic skyrmion: a whirling nanoscopic spin configuration that carries a topological charge ( essentially a twist of spins wrapping a sphere). Skyrmions act like particles embedded in a magnetic field and are extraordinarily stable to perturbations, because erasing a skyrmion requires a coordinated flip of many spins at once (a high energy barrier). Researchers anticipate using magnetic skyrmions as bits in future memory devices, since a bit encoded by the presence or absence of a skyrmion in a nanotrack would be much more stable against thermal noise than a conventional uniform domain bit
en.wikipedia.org
. 

Magnetic skyrmions (topologically twisted spin configurations) can encode digital bits in a robust way. In the image, red vs. blue spin textures represent two distinct topological states (e.g. antiskyrmion vs. skyrmion) corresponding to bit “0” and “1”, respectively. These states are topologically distinct (one cannot smoothly deform the red pattern into the blue), so a skyrmion bit enjoys protection against local disturbances. In practice, a bit is written by creating or deleting a skyrmion on a nanotrack, and it remains stable until a focused operation (like a spin-polarized current pulse) annihilates it
en.wikipedia.org
. This robustness is a form of topological memory in physics. The principle extends beyond magnetism. Topological quantum computing schemes, for instance, aim to store qubits in the joint state of non-abelian anyons – quasiparticles that “remember” how they have been braided around each other. The qubit is not localized but is an emergent property of the entire configuration, and small local errors don’t easily decohere it. In essence, the information is in the global topology of the system’s state. Similarly, a cognitive architecture could encode a piece of information not in one location or one activation value, but in a global topological feature of a field. For example, one might imagine a neural field where activity patterns form loops or knots in an abstract space. The presence of a closed loop of activation might represent a concept, and because it’s a loop (a topologically nontrivial cycle), it might be stable against small perturbations (you can wiggle the loop but it won’t disappear unless the ends meet and cancel). Concepts could be coded as various kinds of topological defects or solitons in a continuous field: not only skyrmions (2D twists) but also domain walls (1D interfaces), vortices (where phase winds around a core), or even higher-dimensional analogues. These constructs have the property that to erase them, the perturbation must be global or sufficiently powerful, otherwise they re-form. For instance, a vortex in a superfluid is characterized by a quantized circulation; no gentle stir will eliminate it – you must specifically unwind it. Translating that to memory: if a concept is a vortex-like rotation in a dynamic state space, it won’t vanish due to a bit flip here or there; it’s resilient by design. Topologically protected memory has been demonstrated in optical and electronic systems as well. A recent photonic device created topologically protected optical memory states, where light circulates in protected edge modes of a metamaterial and can represent a bit that is immune to scattering
photonics.com
nature.com
. Even if the material has imperfections, the light stays in its loop until intentionally extracted. This is analogous to storing a thought in a “light loop” that can circle indefinitely without getting lost – an attractive idea for maintaining cognitive context. Moreover, topological invariants (like winding numbers) could encode associations: two pieces of information might be linked if they form parts of the same topological object (e.g. two ends of a knotted field line). Only by considering the field as a whole (both ends together) can the state be changed, so the association has built-in integrity. Such representations might address the memory integrity problem at planetary scale: even if local nodes or links fail, the overall topological state remains, as long as the global structure is intact. This recalls how the internet routes around failures – here the information routes around noise by virtue of being delocalized in a protected manner. From a mathematical modeling perspective, including topology means dealing with nonlinear field theories that admit soliton solutions. Equations like the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, sine-Gordon equation, or $\mathbb{O}(3)$ sigma model yield stable solitons and could be candidates for the field dynamics in TORI’s core. For example, the sine-Gordon model in 1D supports topologically distinct vacua and kink solitons (domain walls) connecting them; a kink could represent a 1 bit and an anti-kink 0, and they are inherently robust as they cannot vanish without meeting and annihilating. In higher dimensions, the Ginzburg–Landau free energy with appropriate terms yields vortices (topologically quantized phase windings). One might simulate a 2D complex field $\psi(x,y)$ whose phase winds by $2\pi n$ around some cores – those integer $n$ are conserved quantities acting like memory registers. A simple equation for such a field is $\partial_t \psi = D \nabla^2 \psi + \psi(|\psi|^2 - \eta^2)$ (a form of complex Ginzburg–Landau); this has ring-like attractor solutions for certain parameters.

In summary, topology offers a design paradigm for TORI: represent key memories and mappings in forms that have built-in error-correction via physics – any local perturbation that doesn’t match the global topology simply gets corrected (like a rubber band snapping back when plucked, unless you cut it). Such topologically encoded memories would ensure high integrity and longevity, which is especially important if we envision a planetary-scale cognitive architecture where we cannot perfectly control or synchronize every part at all times.
Field-Theoretic and Wave-Based Computation (Beyond Vector Databases)
A fundamental goal of TORI is to move past the paradigm of “embed vectors in a database and do nearest-neighbor search” that current AI systems rely on. Instead, TORI would use continuous fields and waves to store and retrieve information in a content-addressable way. In essence, this means treating memory and computation as an analog physics process – more like holography, diffraction, and resonance – rather than digital list indexing. Fortunately, physics provides many models of computation that work exactly on these principles. One of the most direct analogues is optical holography and Fourier optics. A hologram is an interference pattern recorded on a film; it encodes an image (or multiple images) in a delocalized form. When you shine the reference laser beam on the holographic film, the stored image appears in the diffracted light field, effectively performing an associative recall (you provided a part – the reference wave – and got the whole associated pattern back). Moreover, any part of a hologram contains the entire image, albeit at lower resolution – a property stemming from the Fourier transform nature of holographic storage
en.wikipedia.org
. This means the information is redundantly spread out, and the memory retrieval is robust to partial damage or incomplete queries
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. Karl Pribram’s holonomic brain theory took inspiration from this: it posits that the brain’s memory is stored in distributed interference patterns of neural activity, with each dendritic tree encoding whole memories via phase relationships
en.wikipedia.org
. Pribram noted that brain processes (like vision) could be understood as taking Fourier transforms of inputs, and that any sufficiently large fragment of the cortical pattern could regenerate the whole memory, similar to how any patch of a hologram can reconstruct the entire stored image (with some blurring)
en.wikipedia.org
. This is exactly the kind of context-preserving memory TORI desires – where context isn’t lost when retrieving sub-parts, because the full associative pattern is implicitly present. To implement holographic or wave-based memory in practice, one can use convolution and correlation operations which are naturally performed by physics. An optical lens, for instance, computes a Fourier transform in the propagation of light; two beams interfering perform an on-the-fly multiplication and integration of signals (essentially a dot product in wave terms). If TORI stored knowledge as a holographic interference pattern in some medium (it could be an actual photonic crystal, or an abstract wave in a simulated field), querying that memory could involve generating a wave pattern corresponding to the partial cue. The physics of wave propagation would then match the pattern against the stored interference and a resonance or constructive interference would occur preferentially for the matching memory, thereby retrieving it. In optical terms, this is akin to a VanderLugt optical correlator or a holographic associative memory system which can recall an entire image from a fragment by optical Fourier correlation
file-qyh2ylyl4kqupj7x9dn8d1
. In computing terms, it’s performing a parallel search through an analog mechanism – the wave simultaneously “tries” to match with all stored patterns, and only where it matches do we see a strong signal (like a bright reconstructed image or a peak in correlation output). This is far more parallel and potentially faster than scanning through a list of vectors one by one for similarity scores. Field-theoretic computation also connects to neural field models (like the Amari equation in neural population dynamics), where continuous fields represent activity distribution over feature space, and inputs cause wave propagation or bump attractors to form. These models can do things like pattern completion (which is analogous to associative recall) by virtue of the dynamics of the field – a partial input triggers a self-amplifying wave that reaches the full attractor pattern. The equations here are often integro-differential: e.g. $\partial_t u(x,t) = -u(x,t) + \int w(x,x') f(u(x',t)) dx' + I(x,t)$, where $u(x)$ is the field of neural activation and $w(x,x')$ is a kernel (possibly Fourier-defined) that can retrieve patterns via convolution. Such equations, solved continuously, bypass explicit loops over memory items – the memory is in the kernel and the field state. Another fascinating approach is to use analog electromagnetic fields to represent high-dimensional vectors and perform operations via wave interference. In recent years, there’s been exploration of high-dimensional computing with oscillators and waves. For example, one can represent a 1000-dimensional vector as a superposition of sinusoids across some spectrum or spatial pattern, and perform a convolution (binding) by mixing signals and a superposition (addition) by linear combination – operations that map to physical processes (nonlinear wave mixing and linear superposition, respectively). Pentti Kanerva’s Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) in AI are essentially a mathematical version of this idea: HRRs use circular convolution of vectors to bind symbols, exploiting properties akin to convolution in the frequency domain
file-qyh2ylyl4kqupj7x9dn8d1
. In a photonic or analog context, one could literally multiply and add signals (with modulators, mixers, etc.) to achieve similar results at nanosecond speeds. The “memory” in such a system might be a recurrent waveguide loop that circulates a signal representing the current state of the system (holographically stored), while inputs modulate it to imprint new information or query existing info. Field-theoretic computing also implies using the physics of fields to enforce constraints automatically. For instance, a reaction-diffusion system could potentially do a graph search by having activator-inhibitor chemicals spread and find paths (the famous example is how the Physarum slime mold finds shortest paths in nutrient fields). Though far from conventional computing, these analogies show that data structures can be replaced by self-organizing physical processes. Crucially, a field-based approach enables context preservation: because memory is not a set of independent rows in a table, but an entangled field, any retrieval inherently respects the relationships encoded in the field. If two memories share components or were created in similar contexts, their holographic patterns will overlap; querying one will inevitably bring out parts of the other (a kind of spreading activation), unless actively suppressed. This is similar to how human memory works via association and context. Traditional vector databases, in contrast, typically return a single “best match” and require extra handling to get contextual or relational info.
