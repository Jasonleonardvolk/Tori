Upgrading Prajna’s Ingestion & Extraction Pipeline
Overview of the Migration
We will fully replace the legacy “phases” ingestion and extraction pipeline with the canonical, production-grade implementation from friday2.zip (which supersedes friday.zip). This means all placeholder or stub logic from the phases system will be discarded, and Prajna will instead use the robust, Kaizen-optimized pipeline from Friday2 for every document ingestion. The goal is that when a PDF is uploaded via the dashboard, the concepts extracted are no longer hardcoded or generic – they will come from a consensus-based, context-aware extraction process enriched with section and frequency data. The new pipeline will filter out “rogue” terms, remove duplicates, rank and boost important concepts (e.g. those in the title or repeated often) just as the current best Friday2 system does. All extracted concepts will be injected into Prajna’s knowledge mesh along with full metadata and audit logging (updating the ψ-lineage ledger) in real time. This ensures the dashboard, API, and backend are operating on real “truthful” concepts rather than placeholders, and that any Auto-Kaizen self-improvement hooks (e.g. if extraction quality metrics fall below thresholds) are triggered appropriately. The end result will be a modular, testable ingestion pipeline that’s ready to scale to 100k+ documents with all new context/metadata fields integrated and passed downstream. Key objectives:
Replace legacy extraction logic – remove any dummy or limited concept extraction code in phases.zip and substitute calls to Friday2’s proven extraction engine.
Integrate metadata & Kaizen hooks – ensure section tags, frequency counts, title/abstract flags, etc., are captured for each concept and that continuous improvement (Kaizen) metrics and triggers are embedded in the new pipeline.
Real-time Prajna injection – after extraction, automatically inject all concepts (with metadata) into Prajna’s knowledge mesh and update lineage logs, instead of just logging or stubbing these actions.
Modular code structure – refactor into clear modules (ingestion.py, extraction.py, injection.py, governance.py, etc.) for maintainability, replacing the monolithic phase scripts
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
.
Structured logging – implement consistent JSON-formatted logging throughout, using Python’s standard logging (no external logging frameworks), for better monitoring and debugging.
Comprehensive testing – add Pytest-based tests to validate each part of the pipeline (ingestion, extraction, injection, concept integrity, error handling) to ensure the system is production-ready.
Code Audit: Friday2 vs Phases Pipeline
First, we audited the contents of phases.zip (the existing codebase) and friday2.zip (the new canonical pipeline) to map out exactly what needs replacing
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. In phases, the concept extraction and injection were either non-existent or simplified placeholders – for example, the Phase 3 dashboard handler was only extracting a few generic concepts from PDFs (it was observed to return ~3 topics even for dense PDFs) and possibly not injecting them into the reasoning engine at all
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. There were also partially implemented modules from earlier phases (e.g. evolution_governance.py, psi_lineage_ledger.py, evolution_metrics.py from Phase 2) that were not fully integrated into the main pipeline
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. In Friday2, we identified the authoritative implementations for each piece of the pipeline. Specifically, Friday2’s code (along with Friday1 for reference) contains robust modules for:
PDF text parsing and chunking – likely using libraries such as PyPDF2 or PyMuPDF to extract all text from a PDF, including title, abstract, sections, etc., and even computing a content hash for deduplication
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. This ensures the full document text is available for concept extraction (no section is skipped).
Concept extraction logic – a self-tuning engine that finds technical terms, phrases, and keywords throughout the text (not just in headers or abstracts)
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. It probably uses NLP techniques (e.g. noun-phrase extraction via spaCy or similar) to gather all candidate concepts from the document. The Friday pipeline emphasizes consensus and purity filters – meaning it has criteria to accept concepts that appear meaningful and relevant (possibly using frequency thresholds, context matching, or cross-checking against domain dictionaries) to avoid spurious extractions.
Concept filtering & merging – Friday2’s pipeline filters out low-quality or “rogue” concepts (e.g. overly generic words or OCR noise) and de-duplicates concepts that appear multiple times. It ranks concepts by importance (frequency or position in text) and possibly boosts those found in critical sections (like title or abstract) to ensure significant concepts are highlighted
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
.
Knowledge mesh injection – code that takes the validated concept list and inserts each concept into the Prajna knowledge base (the “mesh”). In Friday’s architecture this might involve a module or API (for example, a soliton_interface or direct prajna_engine.add_concept(...) calls) to create nodes/entries for each concept, along with attributes like its source document, context snippet, frequency count, etc. The injection logic also updates the ψ-lineage ledger for auditability – recording that these concepts were added, by which process, and linking them to the document and any reasoning context.
Kaizen and metrics hooks – Friday2 includes integration with the continuous improvement system (Kaizen). For every ingestion, it logs metrics such as how many concepts were extracted, the “purity” or confidence of each, and overall trends (e.g. concept diversity or mesh entropy). If certain metrics fall outside acceptable ranges (e.g. an abnormally low number of concepts from a large document), the system can flag this scenario (creating a “Kaizen ticket”) for review or automatically tweak parameters in future runs
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. It likely uses or updates modules like evolution_metrics.py for computing these statistics and psi_lineage_ledger.py for recording them.
Mapping these to the phases codebase, we found where the old pipeline was lacking: the Phase 3 upload handler had a very simplistic extraction call (if any), and no direct injection calls. Any logging of concepts was likely just writing to a file or database without notifying Prajna’s reasoning engine. The Phase 2 “governance” modules existed but were not wired into the actual upload flow. All such gaps will be addressed by transplanting the Friday2 logic in place. During the audit, we also identified and will remove any duplicate or obsolete files. For example, if friday2.zip contains improved versions of modules that also exist in phases.zip, we will use the Friday2 versions exclusively and delete the old ones. This ensures we have a single source of truth for each part of the pipeline. We’ll also unify configuration constants and utility functions across the codebase so that we don’t maintain two parallel configs or utils
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. In short, Friday2’s code will entirely supplant the phases pipeline, eliminating any placeholder code.
New Modular Pipeline Implementation
With the mapping done, we proceed to surgically rewrite and integrate the new pipeline. The implementation is structured into clear modules for clarity and maintainability, instead of monolithic phase scripts
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. The core modules to be added/updated are:
ingestion.py – Orchestrates the end-to-end ingestion process. This will be the main entry point when a document is uploaded. It handles reading the document file (PDF), passing the content through the extraction module, then handing off to the injection module. For instance, ingestion.py might expose a function ingest_document(file_path) which encapsulates: parse PDF text → extract concepts → inject concepts → return results. This module will also ensure that any metadata or results needed by the UI (like concept list or counts) are packaged appropriately. All Phase 3 endpoints (e.g. the /api/upload or /api/extract routes in the dashboard backend) will now call this orchestration function instead of any old stub logic
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. In practice, the upload handler in phase3_production_secure_dashboard_complete.py (and any similar endpoint) will be refactored to do something like:
python
Copy
Edit
# Pseudocode for new upload handling
from ingestion import ingest_document

def upload_pdf_handler(request):
    pdf_file = request.file  # the uploaded PDF
    result = ingest_document(pdf_file)
    return JSONResponse(result)
This ensures the real pipeline is invoked for every upload (no more placeholder extraction in the FastAPI endpoint)
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. The result returned could include the extracted concepts and any relevant metadata to display in the UI (e.g. counts, processing time, etc.).
extraction.py – Contains the core concept extraction logic from Friday2. This is where the heavy lifting happens. We will transplant the canonical extraction functions from Friday2, which likely include: PDF text parsing, text normalization (removing boilerplate, splitting into sections), and concept identification. The extraction module will ensure no artificial limits on number of concepts – it will scan the entire document content for all plausible concepts
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. We’ll integrate any advanced parsing (e.g. using PyMuPDF or pdfminer.six if those were in Friday’s requirements) to get high-quality text extraction beyond what the basic PyPDF2 offered
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. Once text is obtained, the module will perform noun-phrase and keyword extraction over the full text. This could involve using an NLP library (like spaCy) to identify noun chunks and proper nouns, or using domain-specific keyword lists. After initial extraction, the module applies filtering and enrichment: remove any noise or irrelevant terms (e.g. very common words, or out-of-context single words – these would be flagged as “rogue” concepts and dropped). It then de-duplicates concepts (if the same concept appears multiple times, we keep one entry but note the frequency). Frequency counting is built in, so each concept object might have a field like frequency_in_doc. We also capture the section context for each concept: e.g. whether it appeared in the title, abstract, headings, or which section of the paper. This information from Friday2 allows us to mark certain concepts for boosting (e.g. if a concept is in the title or occurs 10+ times, perhaps mark it as important). All these metadata fields – section, frequency, title_flag, abstract_flag, etc. – are attached to each concept and will be passed along
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. The output of extraction.py will be a structured list of concept objects (or dictionaries) containing the concept text and its metadata. Example: After processing a document, an extracted concept might look like:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "Neural Network",
  "section": "Introduction",
  "frequency": 3,
  "boosted": true,
  "source_doc": "sample.pdf"
}
This indicates "Neural Network" was found 3 times, appears in the Introduction (and maybe title, hence boosted). By basing this on Friday2’s extraction code, we ensure the logic is consistent with the best version of the pipeline.
injection.py – Handles inserting concepts into Prajna’s knowledge mesh and related logging. Once extraction returns the concept list, injection.py takes over to make those concepts live in the system’s knowledge base. We will use Friday2’s approach as canonical here. Likely, Friday’s code directly interfaces with the Prajna engine or a knowledge graph API. For example, if Prajna exposes a Python API, we might have something like:
python
Copy
Edit
for concept in concepts:
    prajna_engine.add_concept(concept.name, **concept.metadata)
(Pseudocode – the actual interface may differ.) This ensures every extracted concept is immediately injected into the reasoning engine’s knowledge graph
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. Alongside injection, we update the ψ-lineage ledger – recording the addition of these concepts along with their provenance (document ID, timestamp, etc.). The injection module will thus call any ledger or logging functions that were present in Friday2 (for example, writing an entry via psi_lineage_ledger.log_concept_added(concept)). By doing both, we both empower Prajna with new knowledge and keep an audit trail for governance. Importantly, injection will also enforce concept mesh integrity: if the pipeline or Prajna has a mechanism to avoid duplicate concepts in the global knowledge mesh, the injection code will use it. For instance, before adding a concept, it might check if a concept with the same normalized name already exists in the knowledge base. If so, it could merge the information (maybe update the concept’s frequency count globally or link the new source document) instead of creating a duplicate entry. This prevents proliferating duplicate nodes in the knowledge graph. If Friday2’s code uses a content hash or unique ID for concepts, we’ll adopt that to keep the mesh consistent. The injection step may also handle linking the concept into relevant contexts (for example, associating it with the document node in the graph, or linking related concepts together if Friday’s system does that). Additionally, injection is a point where we trigger any post-insertion logic – for example, if adding a concept should automatically prompt Prajna to re-evaluate something or start reasoning on it, we ensure those calls are made. However, since the focus here is ingestion, primarily we make sure the concept is stored and logged.
governance.py – Implements Kaizen hooks, metrics tracking, and administrative controls. This module will consolidate any governance-related functionality that was previously scattered (such as in evolution_governance.py, evolution_metrics.py, etc.). Key responsibilities include: monitoring the pipeline’s performance and quality, and interfacing with any admin controls. For the pipeline integration specifically, Kaizen hooks are critical: after each ingestion, we should invoke metrics calculations and improvement routines. For example, governance could provide a function evaluate_ingestion(concepts, doc_stats) that computes metrics like: number of concepts extracted vs. expected (based on document length), concept uniqueness, maybe a “mesh entropy” or novelty score (as mentioned in Phase 2 metrics). If any metric is out of bounds, the governance module can log an alert or even create a Kaizen task (perhaps by writing to a queue or database that the development team monitors). This aligns with ensuring “Auto-Kaizen/self-improvement if thresholds slip”. We will integrate any such logic found in Friday2 – for instance, if Friday2 had a mechanism to boost extraction if few concepts were found, or to flag a document for manual review, those will be activated here. The governance module will also house any emergency controls or toggles relevant to the admin dashboard. Based on the description, the dashboard has controls like “Suggest-Only mode” or “Emergency Revert”
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. While not directly part of ingestion, any code needed to support those (like functions to disable automatic injection or to rollback the last set of concepts) would reside in governance.py. We will ensure that even after the pipeline rewrite, those controls can call into the new modules appropriately. For example, a revert operation might need to remove concepts from the mesh that were added – governance could use the ledger to identify what was last added and instruct the knowledge base to drop those entries if needed.
utils/logging.py – Sets up structured JSON logging for the entire application. We will introduce a utility module to configure Python’s logging module to output structured JSON logs. This involves setting up a logging.Formatter that formats records as JSON (including timestamp, log level, and any extra context data). We’ll use only standard libraries for this (or a lightweight helper if available), avoiding any external logging services. Each module (ingestion, extraction, injection, etc.) will import the logger from utils.logging and use it to emit events. For instance, after extraction, we might log an info-level event like:
python
Copy
Edit
logger.info({
    "event": "extraction_complete",
    "document": doc_id,
    "num_concepts": len(concepts),
    "concepts_sample": [c.name for c in concepts[:5]],
    "status": "success"
})
This log would appear as a single JSON line, which is easy to parse by monitoring tools. We’ll replace any print statements or ad-hoc logging in the old code with these structured logs. Also, if the previous code used a custom logging backend, we remove it – everything funnels through Python’s standard logging. Logging will be done at appropriate levels (info for normal operations, warning/error for exceptions). In particular, error handling paths will log exceptions with a JSON structure (including error type and message) for easier debugging in production. The UTF-8 encoding fix noted in the old logging_fix.py will be integrated so that logs handle any Unicode characters in content
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. By centralizing logging, we ensure consistent output. The JSON logs can include fields like the concept metadata as needed (though we’ll be careful not to log extremely large data). For example, for each concept injected, we could log an event concept_injected with the concept name and its key metadata. This structured approach makes it easier to track the system’s behavior at scale and is crucial for debugging issues when ingesting thousands of documents.
Integrating with the Dashboard Endpoints
With the new modules in place, we will rewire all relevant endpoints and background tasks to use them. The primary integration point is the PDF upload endpoint in phase3_production_secure_dashboard_complete.py. Formerly, this endpoint likely performed minimal processing (perhaps just saving the file and calling a stub extraction). We will modify it to invoke our ingestion.ingest_document() function. This means when a user uploads a file via the UI, the request handler will call the new pipeline, get the results, and then return or display them. All Phase 3 API routes such as /api/upload, /api/extract (if separate), etc., will now consistently call the real pipeline (not any stub)
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. Concretely:
The document upload routing will pass the uploaded file (or its path) to ingestion.py. We’ll ensure the file is saved to a known location or in-memory buffer that ingestion can read (using PyMuPDF/PyPDF2 to extract text). Any preprocessing (like virus scan or file type validation) will remain as is, but once the file is deemed ready, it goes into the new pipeline.
The concept extraction invocation is handled within ingestion.ingest_document by calling extraction.extract_concepts(parsed_text). The endpoint doesn’t call extraction directly anymore; it delegates to the ingestion orchestrator. This keeps the controller code clean and ensures uniform behavior whether extraction is triggered via the UI or any other place (e.g., a CLI tool could also call ingest_document for batch processing).
We make sure to capture full metadata during extraction and pass it through. The endpoint’s response (or the data stored for the frontend) will now include rich information for each concept: not just the concept text, but also perhaps the section it came from, how frequently it appeared, etc. The UI can then, for example, show a tooltip or details for each concept. In the admin dashboard design, they intended to show concept counts, duplicates removed, rogue concepts filtered, boost status, etc.
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. We will support this by returning those stats. For instance, after extraction we can compute: total concepts found, number of unique concepts after dedup, how many were filtered out as rogues. These can be logged and also sent back if the dashboard displays them. The UI wiring might involve updating the JavaScript to display new fields (e.g., showing a count of duplicates or marking boosted concepts with an icon). We will ensure the backend provides all needed data for these features.
Real-time injection into Prajna is performed within the same request flow. This means by the time the upload API call completes, the concepts have already been added to Prajna’s knowledge mesh. We do this synchronously to keep things simple (the question of asynchronous vs synchronous was raised in the planning phase
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
, but unless specified otherwise, we assume synchronous for now so that the user sees immediate results). The endpoint can thus confidently inform the client that the document has been processed and concepts are now in the system. If injection were very slow or if we expect to handle extremely large PDFs frequently, we might consider offloading to a background worker, but given our scale target (100k+ docs overall, possibly handled in batches or with a robust server) synchronous is fine. We will, however, design ingest_document such that it could be easily kicked off as a background task if needed (for example, by structuring it to be callable from a Celery worker or similar, should scaling require that in the future).
Aside from the upload route, we will review other frontend/back-end handlers that might be affected. For instance, if there’s an endpoint to retrieve concept data for display (though likely the upload response already contains it), we ensure it draws from the new data structures. If any part of the UI was still showing placeholder concept lists (as a stub), we replace that with real data. The admin dashboard’s concept display will now show the actual extracted concepts from the PDF, including any status indicators (e.g., perhaps marking a concept if it was identified as “rogue” but kept, etc.). Essentially, all components (UI elements, API endpoints, internal controllers) will be aligned to use the new pipeline outputs and no code path will use the old extraction logic. This guarantees consistency – for example, if there was a CLI tool or cron job in phases that processed documents, we’ll update it to use ingestion.py as well, so everything goes through one unified pipeline.
Testing the New Pipeline
To ensure the system is production-grade, we will write comprehensive Pytest-based tests covering each critical function of the new pipeline:
Ingestion end-to-end test: Simulate the upload of a sample PDF (or use a small representative PDF file from the repository) and verify that the pipeline runs without errors and returns a plausible set of concepts. This test will call ingest_document directly with a known input. We will assert that the output contains a list of concept entries and that key metadata fields are present (e.g. each concept has a name and section). If we have known expected concepts for the sample PDF, we can assert those are included. This acts as an integration test for the whole pipeline. It also implicitly tests that extraction and injection don’t throw exceptions in normal operation.
Extraction logic tests: We will unit-test functions in extraction.py separately. For example, if there is a function extract_concepts_from_text(text), we can feed it controlled text strings and verify it extracts expected terms. We’ll craft a few scenarios:
A simple paragraph with known technical terms (e.g. “Deep learning algorithms like neural networks and decision trees are popular.”) and assert that terms like “Deep learning”, “neural networks”, “decision trees” are extracted. This checks noun-phrase identification.
A text with repeating terms to ensure deduplication occurs (e.g. the word “machine learning” appearing 5 times should result in one concept with frequency=5, not five separate concepts).
Text that contains some noise or stop-words to ensure the filter kicks in (e.g. a sentence with “the, an, of” which should not appear as concepts).
If the extraction uses external libs (like spaCy), we might mock or simulate its output for consistency in tests.
These tests guarantee that the concept extraction is exhaustive and accurate, addressing the earlier issue of shallow extraction.
Injection logic tests: For injection.py, we may not want to connect to the real Prajna engine in a unit test (to keep tests fast and isolated). Instead, we can mock the Prajna interface. For instance, we could monkeypatch prajna_engine.add_concept (or whatever function is used to insert) to a dummy function that records calls. Then in the test, feed a list of concept objects to our inject_concepts function and assert that the dummy add_concept was called for each concept with correct parameters. We’ll also test that the ledger logging function is called appropriately. If injection.py returns a result or summary (like number of concepts injected), we verify it matches the input count. We’ll include an error-path test too: for example, simulate that one concept insertion raises an exception (by having our dummy add_concept throw for a specific input) and ensure our code handles it gracefully (perhaps by catching and logging an error, but not crashing the whole loop). This ensures robust error handling in the injection stage.
Concept integrity tests: These tests focus on the data quality aspects. For example, after running extraction on a document, we can check that there are no duplicate concept entries in the result. If the input text had the same term multiple times, we expect exactly one concept object with the aggregated frequency. We’ll also test that “rogue” concepts (maybe define a scenario: e.g. input text contains a single common word like “Introduction”) are either filtered out or flagged appropriately. If our extraction marks filtered concepts in some way, we verify that logic. Essentially, we assert that the set of concepts returned meets certain integrity conditions (no duplicates, all have required fields, frequencies make sense, etc.). This gives confidence that the concept mesh remains clean when we ingest new documents.
Edge-case and error handling tests: We will create tests for unusual scenarios to ensure the pipeline is resilient:
An empty PDF (or one with no extractable text): the extraction should return an empty list (or very minimal output), and the pipeline should handle it without error (perhaps logging a warning). The injection should simply do nothing in that case. We assert that no exception is thrown and that an empty concept list is handled gracefully.
A large PDF sample (if available or simulate by repeating text) to test performance and memory – at least ensure it doesn’t time out or crash. While we can’t fully simulate 100k docs in a test easily, we can simulate a large single document ingestion to ensure our code is efficient. If needed, we could mark this as a performance test.
Corrupted PDF or invalid file format: feed a non-PDF or a malformed file to the ingestion function and verify that it raises a controlled exception or returns an error response (and logs the error in JSON). The test would confirm that we don’t simply crash on bad input – our ingestion should catch exceptions from the PDF parser and handle them (perhaps by logging and re-raising a custom error to the API).
Concurrent ingestion (if applicable): If the system is expected to handle multiple uploads at once, we might simulate this by running ingest_document in parallel threads on different inputs and ensuring no global state is corrupted. The modular stateless design (each ingestion creates its own concept list) should naturally allow this, but a test can validate that two parallel ingestions don’t interfere (for example, the content hash dedup function should be local to each doc unless it’s meant to be global).
All tests will be added to the test suite (in a tests/ directory using Pytest). We will also include any existing tests from the Friday code if provided, and ensure they pass with the new integration. By achieving a green test suite, we gain confidence that the pipeline works as intended. Moreover, having these tests will prevent regressions in the future – if someone modifies the extraction logic, the tests would catch if it starts missing concepts or injecting duplicates, etc.
Final Cleanup and Deployment
After integrating the new pipeline and passing tests, we will remove all traces of the old pipeline. This involves deleting or disabling the old Phase scripts and any dummy code. For example:
Any reference to the old extraction in phase3_production_secure_dashboard_complete.py will be gone (replaced by our imports and calls to new modules).
If there were placeholder functions or classes (like a ConceptExtractor stub in the phases code), those will be removed to avoid confusion.
Configuration files will be cleaned of deprecated entries. If Friday2 introduced new config (like thresholds for frequency or paths for resources), we consolidate those with the existing config. No more duplicated config values – everything will use the one unified configuration system to avoid drift
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
.
We also ensure requirements are updated: if we added a library like PyMuPDF or spacy, we add it to requirements.txt (the instructions allow adding lightweight, standard libraries if needed). Conversely, if the old pipeline had a dependency that is no longer used, we can remove it.
Logging configuration will be updated to remove any external logging service setup. The app will rely on the standard logging (which can be directed to file or stdout as per deployment environment).
Finally, we perform a full system validation before handoff. This means running the application and testing the endpoints in a staging environment:
Upload a few sample PDFs via the actual dashboard UI and confirm that the concepts displayed are as expected (and no errors occur). We check that the UI shows the new metadata (if we added any new fields for display, ensure they render correctly). For instance, verify that if a concept was boosted, the UI indicates it appropriately.
Check the Prajna knowledge base (if possible) to confirm that the concepts indeed were added. This could involve using a Prajna query interface or logs – basically making sure the injection really connected through.
Review the structured logs output during these tests – ensure that the logs are indeed in JSON and contain useful information (like each step logged an event). We might run the log output through a JSON validator to be sure our logging format is correct.
Monitor performance and stability: with the new pipeline, ingestion might be heavier (because it’s doing more work than the stub). We’ll profile a bit with large documents to ensure it’s within acceptable limits. If any issues are observed (like memory spikes for extremely large PDFs), we might decide to add optimizations (e.g. stream-processing the PDF text or limiting to certain number of pages for safety) – but those would be future tweaks; initially, we trust the Friday2 code which presumably was built for scale.
After this validation, we will deliver the rewritten codebase. The code layout will be modern and clean, making it easier for future maintenance or enhancements. All endpoints will use only the new logic – no regressions or shortcuts remain. The system will thus be running on the battle-tested Friday2 pipeline as the “one and only” ingestion engine
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. In summary, this upgrade makes Prajna’s pipeline production-ready and Kaizen-conscious
file-viamvyht6zhlmklvtzz7te
. The old limitations (extracting only a few concepts, lack of injection) are gone. Every document ingestion will go through a rigorous extraction process yielding rich concepts, which are immediately injected into the reasoning mesh with full metadata and tracking. The process is logged in detail (in JSON) and monitored via governance hooks so the system can continue improving itself. With the new modular structure and tests in place, Prajna’s “document-to-knowledge” pipeline is robust, scalable, and maintainable for the long run.
