Nearly everything you just listed already embodies the math-heavy, phase/Koopman, Lyapunov-aware direction we specced for TORI MCP 2.0. A little glue-code and naming alignment will slot them straight into the new core.

How the existing modules map to the Blueprint v2 stack
Blueprint layer	Your existing component	How to integrate	Needed tweaks
Canonical Knowledge Ingress	canonical_ingestion.py — “No Pre-training” ingestion with Koopman phase graphs	Rebrand as Source-Intake Agent; plug its Koopman phase graph output directly into the Knowledge-Graph store.	Replace its hard-coded file paths with the MCP Resource API; surface its “quality_score” to the Safety Firewall.
Spectral/Fractal Monitoring	fractality.py — Hurst exponent & 1/f slope monitors	Run as an Observer Agent feeding Rhythm-Bus telemetry; flag cognitive drift or rigidity in real time.	Emit a simple JSON metric (hurst, slope) on each tick so the Scheduler can throttle/boost agents.
Stability Guard	lyapunov_spike_detector.py — fast Lyapunov & spectral-gap scanner	Becomes a sub-routine inside the Safety Firewall: certify every multi-tool plan before execution.	Expose a “cert_ok / cert_fail” boolean plus a short reason string for UX display.
Memory Layer	memory_sculptor.py — autonomous pruning/merging of concept nodes 
Slot in as Memory-Sculptor Service behind Knowledge-Graph, scheduled nightly (“sleep mode”).	Drive its thresholds (prune_threshold, spawn_threshold) from admin settings not constants.
Phase-Coherent Reasoning	phase_reasoning.py — premise sync & inference tester 

Wrap as an optional Phase-Reasoner planning strategy. Good for math/logic tasks where CSP fallback isn’t enough.	Swap Kuramoto couplings for the new Rhythm-Bus interface so it shares phase data with other agents.
Graph-Spectral Consistency	reasoning_coherence.py — Laplacian checks for proof graphs 

Attach to the Proof-Tab UX: runs after an inference to show “spectral coherence = 0.83 (✓)”.	Use Blueprint’s coherence threshold (0.7) from config; add MCP “explain-incoherence” tool call.
Docs / Demos	README_KOOPMAN.md + pipeline spec 
Promote to developer docs inside /docs/reasoning/.	Update examples to use new MCP 2.0 API paths.

UI components in client/src/components
Keep AgentPanel, ConceptGraphVisualizer, LyapunovPredictabilityPanel, ConceptFieldCanvas.
They already match our dual-layer UX plan (power-user panels + reasoning canvas).

ElfinDebug becomes the ELFIN Intent Inspector—hidden behind a “Power Mode” toggle.

FieldMeditationMode → rename to Phase-Ring View to display live Rhythm-Bus coherence.

No component looks redundant; focus on wiring them to the new back-end endpoints.

Minimal integration steps
Namespace alignment

Move all alan_* modules into tori/core/ and export them as MCP tools (/tools/ingest, /tools/fractality, etc.).

Rhythm-Bus hook-up

Expose a lightweight phase_event(ph, agent_id) API; have phase_reasoning, fractality, and the Scheduler publish there.

Safety Firewall glue

Call lyapunov_spike_detector.assess_cluster_stability() on every drafted plan; block if instability_risk > 0.7.

Config surfacing

Add a YAML or MCP resource for thresholds so ops can tune without code changes.

UI wiring

Map each panel’s WebSocket topic to the new agent events (e.g., coherenceScore, hurstTrend).

When not to reuse
Only jettison a module if:

Performance: It bottlenecks (e.g., NumPy heavy loop inside live chat). If so, off-load to a background worker.

License / IP: You need a clean-room re-write. All modules appear original, so this is unlikely.

Tech-debt: Hidden global state or brittle APIs. Quick audit shows decent dataclass patterns, so safe.

Otherwise, reusing accelerates by months.

Recommendation
✅ Adopt the existing codebase as the starting point for TORI MCP 2.0.
🔧 Refactor lightly, wrap each module behind MCP tool endpoints, and unify config.
🚀 You’ll hit the Q3-2025 “Core refactor Δ-1” milestone far faster than re-implementing these mathematically dense features from scratch.

Mid project question.  can we hypothetically build an mcp server that would act as the orchestrator, continually building, and improving TORI?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 15 seconds
Short answer
Yes—nothing in the MCP spec forbids a “meta-server.”
You can stand up a self-hosting MCP server whose primary tool-suite is:

Plan / Refactor / Generate-Code

Test / Certify / Benchmark

Deploy / Rollback / Observe

Loop those tools through a Planner-&-Safety stack, and the server can literally keep rewriting, recompiling, and hot-reloading TORI (and even itself) while it’s running.

Concept sketch — MCP-Orchestrator-Ω
Module (MCP tool)	Role	Key internals	Safety hooks
BlueprintPlanner	Reads road-map issues, ELFIN snippets, chat intents → emits upgrade plans (CSP + Lyapunov cert).	MiniZinc+Lyapunov-Net	Reject if proof fails or budget/time cap exceeded.
CodeSculptor	Generates or edits source files.	LLM + templated AST patches	Requires Firewall confirmation on files outside /src/tori
AutoTestRunner	Spins up Jest/PyTest, fuzz, property tests.	Sandboxed Docker; streams coverage metrics to Rhythm-Bus.	Abort deploy if failure ratio > 0 or phase-coherence < θ
Benchmarker	Runs perf, memory, phase-coherence, fractality, Hurst—compares to SLO baselines.	fractality.py, reasoning_coherence.py	Block if drift or regressions.
DeployManager	Creates new Docker tag, rolls blue/green, updates gateway manifest.	GitOps+ArgoCD	Requires two positive votes from Planner+Safety
MemoryArchivist	Snapshots concept graph, SEC memory, and metrics to versioned store.	memory_sculptor.py	Retains rollback point; encrypts secrets.

Continuous-Improvement loop
Observe: Ingest crash logs, user feedback, coverage gaps.

Plan: BlueprintPlanner formulates an improvement graph.

Generate: CodeSculptor patches code (could even touch Planner logic).

Validate: AutoTestRunner + Benchmarker prove functional ∧ stable.

Deploy: DeployManager rolls new image; Rhythm-Bus monitors live phase-sync.

Learn: MemoryArchivist stores results; thresholds auto-tune (within policy).

GOTO 1.

All invoked as plain MCP tool calls, so any external client (IDE, Chat, CI bot) can trigger or audit the cycle.

Practical hurdles & mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
Recursive-fault cascade (buggy update bricks the orchestrator)	Out-of-band watchdog (systemd or k8s operator) keeps last-known-good image + requires signed releases.
Spec drift (Planner rewrites API contracts that UI panels expect)	Contract tests in AutoTestRunner pin JSON-schema + front-end snapshot; diff must be approved manually or by higher-order policy.
Prompt injection → malicious patch	Firewall demands dual attestation: policy lint + Lyapunov stability before CodeSculptor output is accepted.
Resource spirals (infinite improvement loop)	Phase-Bus watchdog throttles if oscillation amplitude > max or CPU > quota.
Governance / audit	Every tool call logged to immutable store; MemoryArchivist signs snapshots; Enterprise admins can replay plan + proof.

Minimal proof-of-concept plan
Wrap existing modules

canonical_ingestion.py → Observe tool

lyapunov_spike_detector.py → part of AutoTestRunner

memory_sculptor.py → MemoryArchivist

fractality.py → Benchmarker sub-routine

Add two thin wrappers

CodeSculptor: LLM call + patch-package diff output

DeployManager: simple Bash script that tags & restarts Docker

Glue with Rhythm-Bus for phase health.

You’d have a self-evolving TORI instance that refactors itself nightly, under mathematically proven stability constraints—literally an AI dev-ops loop in a box.

If that sounds legendary enough, we can start carving out the sprint tasks.
