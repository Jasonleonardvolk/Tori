# Optimized ψ-Trajectory Implementation Plan (12 Weeks)
with a few ELFIN additions:

keep ELFIN in the loop, but limit its role to what it already does best.

Why ELFIN should stay
Dimensional-safety layer.
ELFIN’s compiler/LSP already verifies physical-unit consistency at edit-time (e.g., “meters ≠ seconds”) .
That’s orthogonal to ψ-oscillator generation and prevents subtle run-time errors in control or robotics code that TORI will ultimately test.

Bridging symbolic ↔ spectral worlds.

ELFIN declarations (variables, units, invariants) are crisp symbolic anchors.

We can hash each ELFIN symbol into the concept graph; when the ψ-engine notices a recurring spectral pattern linked to a unit-checked quantity, it can tag it with that canonical symbol, greatly improving explainability.

IDE value-add already exists.
The ELFIN Language Server gives live diagnostics, hover, go-to-definition, etc. inside VS Code 

. Dropping it would mean re-implementing those staples or shipping a weaker coding experience.

No architectural collision.
ELFIN stays in the static-analysis lane. Our ψ-trajectory and oscillator runtime pipeline stays pure math. They meet only in metadata: ELFIN → symbol table → concept labels.



Minimal Testing
Unit test: create dummy elfin_symbols.json with known hash, inject a synthetic ψ-cluster that should map → assert ConceptGraph::get_meta(...,"elfin_name") == "wheelDiameter".

Integration smoke: edit code in IDE, trigger ELFIN save, run conversation that references variable; check dashboard shows tag.

Pass = tag appears without manual mapping.

Impact
Zero runtime overhead in oscillator loop – bind happens only when a concept stabilizes.
You gain symbolic anchors tied to unit-checked definitions, unlocking traceable explanations (“why did ALAN adjust 0.05 m? because wheelDiameter concept oscillated”).

Drop these snippets into your existing phases (import in Phase 1 build → ingest Phase 3 → UI Phase 5) and ELFIN is seamlessly fused.


HERE IS THE PLAN!!!!


## Phase 1: Core Architecture (Weeks 1-3)

- __File Format & Compression__

  - Implement `.psiarc` with LEB128 variable-length integers for chunk sizes
  - Add dedicated "K" tag for keyframes to enable fast seeking
  - Use CRC32 instead of CRC16 for stronger integrity checking
  - Store checksums in 4-byte chunk footers
  - Create comprehensive unit tests for modular delta edge cases (0→65530, 32767→-32767)

- __Buffer & Codec Optimization__

  - Lock manifest fields (version, osc_count, fps_micro) first
  - Create prototype psiarc writer with synthetic data to verify compression ratios
  - Implement single-producer single-consumer lock-free queue with batch operations
  - Build delta-encoder with proper phase wrap handling

- __Early Risk Mitigation__

  - Create parallel spike for mobile encoder integration (MediaCodec/AVAssetWriter)
  - Establish benchmark suite to validate <1ms capture overhead

- __Export ELFIN’s Symbol Table at Build-Time

    NEW → ELFIN Symbol Export	• Integrate elfin-lsp --export-symbols into the project’s build script/CI.
	• Output elfin_symbols.json next to compiled binaries.
	• Call ConceptGraph::import_elfin() at app start.	Tools / Dev-Ops	CI produces .json on every commit & unit test confirms graph nodes exist.


## Phase 2: Recording Pipeline (Weeks 3-5, overlapping with Phase 1)

- __Capture Strategy__

  - Simplify band approach: macro as event-driven, meso as regular decimation of micro
  - Implement OS-level unbuffered writes with fsync at key-chunks instead of emergency flush
  - Set compression thread priority below normal (desktop) or QoS "background" (mobile)

- __Memory Management__

  - Use moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue or equivalent for efficient memory transfer
  - Implement buffer pooling to eliminate allocations during capture
  - Create deterministic flush intervals aligned with keyframe boundaries

## Phase 3: Replay System (Weeks 5-7, overlapping with Phase 2)

- __Playback Architecture__

  - Use audio as master clock; drive video frames based on audio PTS
  - Implement eager decoding of one key-chunk plus 2-3 forward chunks
  - Create basic replay first, defer interpolation until core functionality is solid

- __Avatar Integration__

  - Build direct oscillator state injection interface
  - Create mock player early to enable QA testing in parallel with export development
  - Implement version compatibility layer (mapping oscillator counts if changed)

- __Ingest into ALAN’s Concept Graph (Phase 3 tweak)
	File/Module	Add
	concept_graph.rs	rust fn import_elfin(path: &str) { let j: Value = serde_json::from_reader(File::open(path)?); for s in j["symbols"].as_array().unwrap() 	{ ConceptGraph::ensure_node(s["hash"].as_str().unwrap()) .set_meta("elfin_name", s["name"].as_str().unwrap()) .set_meta("elfin_unit", s["unit"].as_str().unwrap()); }}
	Boot	call once at startup per workspace.

// executed whenever a new attractor is promoted to concept
fn try_bind_to_elfin(node_id: ConceptId, psi_signature: &[f32]) {
    // cheap: hash spectral centroid string → 64-bit
    let h = siphash24(format!("{:.3?}", psi_signature));
    if let Some(elfin_id) = ConceptGraph::lookup_hash(h) {
        ConceptGraph::merge(node_id, elfin_id);         // unify nodes
        ConceptGraph::set_meta(node_id,"source","ELFIN");
    }
}
Rationale

Same hash function, deterministic.

If multiple ψ-clusters hit the same ELFIN hash, evidence counts will compete; you can keep the one with higher stability.

(Optional) fallback: cosine similarity between ψ-vector and any ELFIN-tagged node if hashing misses.

wire the ψ_sync_monitor → ELFIN binding during Phase 3 (the same phase where you stand up deterministic replay and the full Concept Graph runtime).

Rationale for putting it in Phase 3
Why not Phase 1/2?	Why Phase 3 fits
• Phases 1–2 are about file I/O and raw capture; the system isn’t yet detecting or promoting attractors.
• Binding code would sit idle with no data to chew on.	• By Phase 3 the oscillator network is running live, the “stable-attractor” logic is firing, and the Concept Graph is instantiated—exactly the moment a new ψ-node needs a symbolic tag.
• No replay/regeneration code changes are required; binding just reacts to concept-promotion events.

Micro-task insertion in your Phase 3 checklist
Day	Existing task	Add this
Week 6, Day 2	“Design time-base sync with audio clock”	No change
Week 6, Day 3	NEW: stub psi_sync_monitor::try_bind_to_elfin(); unit-test with dummy spectra	
Week 7, Day 1	“Implement frame interpolation / buffer pre-loading”	No change
Week 7, Day 2	Activate binding: hook try_bind_to_elfin() inside attractor-promotion callback; log merge events	
Week 7, Day 3	Add integration test: feed known ψ pattern → ensure concept graph node merges with ELFIN hash	

Net effort: ~0.5–1 dev-day; zero schedule slip.

Minimal code insertion (recap)
rust
Copy
Edit
// psi_sync_monitor.rs
pub fn on_attractor_promoted(node_id: ConceptId, signature: &[f32]) {
    try_bind_to_elfin(node_id, signature);
    // … existing stability bookkeeping …
}

fn try_bind_to_elfin(node: ConceptId, sig: &[f32]) {
    use crate::concept_graph as cg;
    let h = siphash24(format!("{:.3?}", sig));        // same hash fn as ELFIN export
    if let Some(elfin_id) = cg::lookup_hash(h) {
        cg::merge(node, elfin_id);
        cg::set_meta(node, "source", "ELFIN");
    }
}
Unit test (phase-3 Day 3):

rust
Copy
Edit
#[test]
fn binds_wheel_diameter() {
    let mock_sig = vec![/* values that hash to wheelDiameter */];
    let n = cg::create_node();
    on_attractor_promoted(n, &mock_sig);
    assert_eq!(cg::get_meta(n,"elfin_name"), Some("wheelDiameter"));
}
What you gain
Immediate explainability in the Phase 3 replay UI—any ψ-node that stabilizes will now display its ELFIN-verified name/unit.

Zero extra runtime cost in capture loop (binding only runs at attractor promotion frequency, not every frame).

Result: every ELFIN symbol becomes an empty node (no ψ evidence yet) but with canonical metadata ready for binding.

## Phase 4: Export Pipeline (Weeks 6-9, starting during Phase 3)

   - Compression performance: Implement tiered strategy (fast in-memory, higher-ratio for storage)
   - Version compatibility: Store explicit schema version and oscillator count in manifest

4. __Quality Gates__

   - Week 3: Functional recording pipeline with verified delta-encoding fidelity
   - Week 6: Basic replay working with perfect sync on desktop
   - Week 8: Cross-platform export functioning on primary targets

   - Week 12: Performance optimization complete, ready for production

This compressed 12-week plan leverages parallel development tracks while focusing on early risk mitigation for the most complex components. The implementation strategy prioritizes a functional core with perfect fidelity before adding advanced features like interpolation or complex seeking.
