Prajna Project – Actionable Development Plan
Core Implementation Tasks
Integrate SolitonMemory & ConceptMesh Backends – Wire up Prajna’s back-end data sources. Replace any stub or dummy interfaces with real connections to the existing Soliton Memory (the Rust-based persistent memory engine) and the Concept Mesh knowledge base. This ensures the context builder is using actual stored data:
Expose a Python API or service for the Rust-based SolitonMemory so Prajna can query it for relevant personal/chat memories.
Connect the ConceptMesh retrieval in context_builder to the real knowledge graph or document index (e.g. via a database or API). Ensure all ingested content (PDF text, video transcripts, image OCR, etc.) is accessible through this interface.
Implement reasoning_engine.py (Multi-hop Reasoning) – Develop a new reasoning engine module for traversal-based Q&A. This component will enable “True Reasoning Traversal” across the knowledge graph, so Prajna can handle multi-hop questions instead of using only flat text context. Key responsibilities include:
Traverse linked concepts in the Concept Mesh (e.g. via ConceptMeshAPI.get_related()) to follow chains of relevant nodes/facts.
Reconstruct multi-hop reasoning chains from an initial query concept through intermediate nodes to the conclusion, tracking the explanation arc (“X causes Y because Z”) along the way.
Rank candidate reasoning paths by relevance – use resonance scores or phase alignment metrics to prioritize the most coherent, causal chain.
Implement ψ_archive.py (Cognitive Event Ledger) – Create a persistent, auditable log of Prajna’s cognitive events. The “psi-archive” will record each query along with its context, the chosen reasoning path, and results, enabling transparency and debugging of the reasoning process. Include functionality to replay a given query’s steps (e.g. a replay_event(event_id) function):
Log every answer event with its input, retrieved context snippets, reasoning chain, final answer, and audit flags. This unified ψ‑Event Ledger will serve as an append-only journal for all Prajna interactions.
Ensure the archive integrates with Prajna’s API (e.g. link entries with query IDs from prajna_api.py) so that each answer’s provenance can be traced and reviewed later (for instance, to analyze how a conclusion was reached or to regenerate answers after updates).
Implement cognitive_consolidator.py (Post-Ingestion Phases) – Build the module for periodic knowledge-base self-organization. After data ingestion, Prajna should run several post-processing phases to improve coherence and learning, as identified in the planning notes:
Coherence Optimization: Regularly detect and fix “phase islands” – clusters of concepts that should be linked but aren’t. Merge or connect related nodes to reduce knowledge fragmentation.
Activation Replay: Re-run recent queries through the system to reinforce important connections. This rehearsal stabilizes key anchors by revisiting and strengthening the paths used.
Concept Consolidation: Merge duplicate or semantically equivalent nodes (even across different modalities) into unified entries. This prevents redundant concepts in the mesh (e.g. linking "Fourier Transform (PDF)" and "Fourier Transform (lecture video)" if they refer to the same concept).
Soliton Pulse Normalization: Periodically normalize memory signal amplitudes based on usage patterns (boost frequently referenced items, down-weight stale ones).
(Optional) Predictive Expansion: Let Prajna hypothesize new links by asking itself “If X, then what?” – proactively adding connections for inferred relationships to expand the mesh (with safeguards to avoid false associations).
Enhance Answer Generation & Auditing – Refine the LLM interaction and answer validation. Make sure Prajna’s answer pipeline is robust and transparent:
Model Prompting: Load the local LLM model at server startup and ensure local_llm_server.generate_answer() uses a proper prompt template. Include a system instruction enforcing “no external knowledge” (e.g. “If the answer is not in the provided context, respond with uncertainty”) to minimize hallucinations.
Inline Source Attribution: Implement per-sentence citations in answers. Each sentence of the LLM’s answer should be traceable to a snippet in the retrieved context or memory. This might involve mapping sentences to source IDs during or after generation, and annotating the answer JSON with these references.
Audit & Ghost Analysis: Strengthen the alien_overlay audit checks. For each answer, automatically flag any statements that aren’t supported by the context (e.g. by checking if key terms in a sentence appear in the source text) and reduce the trust score accordingly. Likewise, use the “ghost feedback” system to identify gaps or implicit questions in the reasoning – e.g. if the answer jumps in logic or poses a question to itself, mark it so that the UI can highlight potential leaps. The goal is a transparent trust metric for every answer.
Multimodal Integration
Extend Prajna to Multimodal Content – Upgrade the system to handle images, audio, and other modalities. This is slated as Module 1.7 (Multimodal Integration) in the Prajna roadmap. Key steps:
Multimodal Ingestion Core: Implement core/multimodal.rs (in Rust) or an equivalent module to ingest and integrate non-text data into the Concept Mesh. For example, when new images or audio files are ingested, their extracted text or features should create new nodes/edges in the knowledge graph.
Analysis Modules: Develop dedicated analysis components for each modality, such as analysis/vision.py for images and analysis/audio.py for audio streams. These should handle tasks like image OCR and feature extraction, audio transcription, etc., producing text or embeddings that can be linked to relevant concepts. Ensure these modules interface with the ConceptMesh API to insert findings (e.g. an OCR’d text snippet from an image goes into the mesh with a reference to the image).
Frontend UI Updates: Expand the Svelte/TypeScript front-end (e.g. a MultimodalUI.tsx component) to support uploading and displaying multimedia content. The UI should allow users to provide images or audio queries and then see the system’s analysis (such as a timeline of events, overlay highlights, or extracted text) alongside the final answer. Also, display source attributions for visual/audio sources similar to text sources (e.g. an image icon with a reference if an answer sentence came from an image).
Model Training & Tuning
Fine-Tune Prajna’s LLM on Internal Data – Train the language model on the project’s exclusive corpus for domain expertise. Using the 23GB TORI corpus and Prajna’s accumulated knowledge, execute a multi-phase training pipeline to create a bespoke model that excels at context-dependent Q&A:
Data Preparation: Extract and clean all relevant text from the Soliton memory and Concept Mesh (documents, transcripts, notes) into a structured training corpus. If needed, generate additional Q&A pairs from the data (e.g. have the system ask and answer questions about each key concept) to augment the training set.
Dataset Construction: Convert the prepared text and Q&A pairs into a machine learning dataset (e.g. JSONL or Torch format) of prompt→completion examples. Ensure each prompt is just the context with a question, and the completion is the correct answer, reinforcing Prajna’s context-only answering behavior.
Tokenizer & Vocab: Build or update the tokenizer to include domain-specific terminology (so that specialized terms from the corpus are not broken or out-of-vocabulary).
Model Training: Train a local language model (such as RWKV or a customized NanoGPT) from scratch on the dataset. This should be done with hyperparameters tuned for long-context handling and the “no external info” constraint (the model learns to rely strictly on provided context). Monitor training to avoid overfitting and ensure it internalizes factual content from the corpus.
Validation: After training, rigorously test the model on a set of held-out queries or scenarios. Verify that it can answer questions using the provided context and that it refuses or defers when information is not in context. Also ensure the model’s outputs still work with Prajna’s auditing layer (e.g. it should generally produce supported statements, and any unsupported ones are caught).
Testing & Deployment
System Testing & Deployment – Validate the end-to-end system, then deploy Prajna into production.
Module Testing: For each new module (reasoning engine, archive, consolidator, multimodal ingestors, etc.), write unit or integration tests as applicable. For example, test that reasoning_engine.py can successfully find and rank a multi-hop path on a small subgraph, or that ψ_archive.py correctly logs and replays an event.
Integration Testing: Run full pipeline tests simulating user queries. Include edge cases: queries that require multi-hop reasoning, queries with insufficient context (to test the “I don’t know” responses), and queries involving images/audio. Ensure that the output JSON contains the answer, source list, inline citations, and audit fields as expected, and that the UI can render all these elements correctly.
Performance & Reliability: If possible, conduct load tests or timing tests for the pipeline (especially after adding the new modules and a larger model). Optimize where necessary (e.g. ensure caching of frequent retrievals, or that the Rust components are efficient).
Deployment: Deploy the updated Prajna system to the target environment. This may involve containerization or integration with the existing TORI architecture. Once live, closely monitor its performance and accuracy with real users. Gather feedback and iteratively refine parameters (e.g. adjust audit thresholds or retrain the model on new data) as needed to meet the project’s goals.
Each of these steps is crucial to Prajna’s development. By following this plan, you will incrementally build a robust, multimodal answer engine: one that not only retrieves and cites information from internal knowledge, but also reasons through complex queries, audits its own answers, and continuously learns from new data. The result will be a production-ready Prajna system that is fully integrated into your architecture and capable of delivering trustworthy, context-grounded answers across text and media inputs.
