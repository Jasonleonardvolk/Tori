# Geometric coupling replaces exotic matter in dark matter wormholes

Non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry in f(Q,T) gravity enables the construction of stable, traversable wormholes without exotic matter, using realistic dark matter profiles that combine quantum solitonic cores with classical NFW halos. This breakthrough by Nashed and El Hanafy demonstrates that geometric modifications can mimic the effects of negative energy density, potentially solving wormhole physics' most fundamental challenge. The work establishes specific parameter ranges where normal matter suffices for wormhole construction, with stability maintained through modified gravitational forces arising from matter-geometry coupling. The theoretical framework opens new possibilities for physically realistic wormholes embedded within dark matter halos, offering testable predictions for future observations.

## The exotic matter problem finds a geometric solution

Traversable wormholes in General Relativity face an insurmountable obstacle: they require exotic matter violating the null energy condition (NEC), demanding negative energy densities that have never been observed. The paper tackles this decades-old problem through **f(Q,T) gravity**, where Q represents the non-metricity scalar and T is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. This theory replaces curvature-based gravity with non-metricity while maintaining zero torsion, creating a symmetric teleparallel framework where spacetime's fundamental character differs from Einstein's formulation.

The specific model f(Q,T) = Q + βT introduces a crucial coupling parameter β that controls matter-geometry interaction strength. When β ≠ 0, additional geometric terms arise in the field equations that can effectively mimic exotic matter behavior. The modified field equations take the form:

**-½P_μ^αβ∇_α∇_β g_μν + ¼(f_Q g_μν - Q g_μν) = 8πG T_μν + 8πG β(T_μν + Θ_μν)**

where Θ_μν contains the matter-geometry coupling terms that fundamentally alter wormhole physics. These additional terms provide the negative pressure effects traditionally requiring exotic matter, but through purely geometric modifications rather than unusual matter sources.

## Dark matter profiles bridge quantum and classical scales

The paper employs a sophisticated dual dark matter profile approach that captures both quantum mechanical effects at small scales and classical behavior at large scales. At the wormhole throat and inner regions, a **solitonic core profile** dominates:

**ρ_sol(r) = ρ_c/[1 + (r/r_c)²]⁸**

This profile emerges from fuzzy/wave dark matter models where quantum uncertainty effects create stable cores preventing gravitational collapse. The steep r⁻¹⁶ falloff ensures finite central densities while the core radius r_c relates to the dark matter particle mass through quantum mechanical constraints.

Beyond approximately 3r_c, the profile transitions smoothly to the universal **Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile**:

**ρ_NFW(r) = ρ_s/[(r/r_s)(1 + r/r_s)²]**

This classical cold dark matter distribution, with its characteristic r⁻¹ inner slope and r⁻³ outer falloff, has been verified through countless observations of galaxy halos. The composite profile thus provides a physically motivated matter source spanning from quantum to cosmological scales.

## Wormhole stability emerges from modified gravitational forces

The stability analysis reveals how non-minimal coupling fundamentally alters wormhole dynamics through a modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation. Beyond the standard gravitational and pressure gradient terms, an additional force appears:

**F_coupling = β ∂/∂r[T(r)/8πG]**

This coupling force can be attractive or repulsive depending on β's sign, providing a new stabilization mechanism absent in General Relativity. For **negative coupling parameters**, the force opposes gravitational collapse, enabling stable configurations without exotic matter when:

**β + α/2 < -1/(ρr₀²) - 8π**

The shape function b(r) = r₀[ρ_DM(r)/ρ_DM(r₀)]^α automatically satisfies the flaring-out condition db/dr|_r=r₀ < 1 for appropriate α values, ensuring traversability. The asymptotic flatness requirement b(r)/r → 0 as r → ∞ follows naturally from the NFW profile's r⁻³ behavior at large radii.

## Energy conditions reveal parameter space for physical solutions

The systematic analysis of energy conditions uncovers specific parameter ranges permitting wormholes without exotic matter. The null energy condition T_μν k^μ k^ν ≥ 0, typically violated in GR wormholes, can be **satisfied** in f(Q,T) gravity through geometric contributions rather than negative energy densities. 

For positive coupling (β > 0), NEC satisfaction is possible but often breaks the flaring-out condition, yielding non-traversable geometries. However, **negative coupling** (β < 0) permits a sweet spot where both NEC satisfaction and traversability coexist. The critical insight is that geometric terms effectively provide the negative pressure traditionally requiring exotic matter, but through modified field equations rather than unusual matter states.

The weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions follow similar patterns, with negative β generally providing larger regions of parameter space for physical solutions. The dominant energy condition's satisfaction ensures causal energy-momentum flow, critical for physical viability.

## Observable signatures distinguish geometric wormholes

The distinctive features of f(Q,T) wormholes offer potential observational tests distinguishing them from both black holes and hypothetical GR wormholes. Gravitational lensing signatures differ due to the modified deflection angles arising from matter-geometry coupling. The composite dark matter profile creates unique dynamical signatures in stellar orbits near the throat.

The stability against perturbations differs markedly from GR cases, with the additional coupling forces damping certain instability modes. This enhanced stability might manifest in gravitational wave signals from matter accreting onto the wormhole, producing distinctive ringdown patterns. The energy condition satisfaction patterns also create different limits on the minimum throat size compared to exotic matter wormholes.

Perhaps most intriguingly, these wormholes naturally embed within dark matter halos, suggesting they could form in high-density regions of the early universe where solitonic cores develop. This provides a formation mechanism absent for exotic matter wormholes, potentially making them more than mathematical curiosities.

## Conclusion

The paper establishes f(Q,T) gravity as a promising framework for constructing physically realistic traversable wormholes, fundamentally addressing the exotic matter problem through geometric modifications. By incorporating astrophysically motivated dark matter profiles and demonstrating stability without violating energy conditions, the work bridges the gap between mathematical possibility and physical plausibility. The specific parameter constraints β < -1/(ρr₀²) - 8π provide concrete targets for model building, while the observable signatures offer hope for eventual empirical verification. This geometric solution to wormhole physics' greatest challenge opens new theoretical avenues and suggests that traversable wormholes might exist within the dark matter halos pervading our universe, awaiting discovery through their unique gravitational signatures.
