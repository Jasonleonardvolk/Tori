Design and Integration Plan for Prajna Multimodal Reasoning System

Prajna Multimodal Answer Engine: Technical Development Plan
Overview and Goals
Prajna is envisioned as the “brain” of the TORI system – a multimodal answer engine that can ingest user queries (text and media), retrieve relevant internal knowledge with source citations, reason through complex questions, audit its answers for factuality/coherence, and continuously learn from new information. At its core, Prajna follows a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline【15†】: it fetches supporting context from a local knowledge base and uses a language model to synthesize an answer, rather than relying on parametric memory alone. This design ensures grounded answers (Prajna “speaks” only from known, ingested knowledge) and supports privacy (all data stays local). Key objectives include:
Multimodal Understanding: Handle text queries plus image/audio inputs by integrating perception modules.
Cited Knowledge Retrieval: Pull relevant facts from Soliton Memory (personal conversation memory) and Concept Mesh (a knowledge graph of ingested files) and provide source references【68†】.
Reasoning & Synthesis: Use an LLM to generate answers that integrate the retrieved knowledge and logical reasoning (e.g. multi-step or symbolic reasoning when needed).
Answer Auditing: Include an “alignment layer” that checks the answer for correctness, consistency with sources, and compliance (no toxic or unsupported content).
Continuous Learning: Implement feedback loops so the system improves over time – updating its knowledge base with new data, adapting its model using feedback, and even self-tuning its algorithms.
Below we detail the architecture components, their responsibilities and interactions, along with mathematical/logical formulations and strategies for continuous improvement.
System Architecture Overview
The Prajna engine is composed of modular components arranged in a pipeline. The high-level data flow for a query is illustrated below:

Figure: Prajna Query Handling Pipeline. A user query is received through the front-end, relevant context is retrieved from the knowledge base, the LLM generates an answer, an alignment/audit overlay validates the answer, and the answer (with citations) is returned to the user. Each downward arrow highlights key supporting modules: the Frontend UI for user interaction, the Soliton Memory / Concept Mesh knowledge base for context, the local Language Model for generation, the Trust Audit checks in the Alien Overlay, and finally the user-facing interface for output.
1. Frontend Interface and API Layer
Frontend (UI): The user interacts with Prajna via a chat interface (e.g. a Svelte component PrajnaChat as scaffolded in the 071 archive). This interface accepts text queries and file or image uploads for multimodal questions. It displays answers along with cited sources (e.g. “【source†】” links) and any confidence indicators. The UI can also handle streaming responses: as the LLM generates text, tokens are sent incrementally (the Claude scaffolding includes a WebSocket stream_prajna() function for this). This improves responsiveness for long answers. API Layer: Behind the UI, a backend API (e.g. a FastAPI server) orchestrates the query-answering pipeline. An endpoint like POST /api/answer receives a JSON payload (as defined by a Pydantic model PrajnaRequest in the Claude scaffolding) containing: the user’s query, an optional focus_concept (to guide retrieval), and a conversation_id for context continuity. The API layer orchestrates the steps: it invokes the Context Builder to retrieve knowledge, calls the LLM module to generate an answer, runs the Alien Overlay audit, then returns the final answer with citations. This layer also manages session memory: if a conversation_id is provided, it can log the Q&A into Soliton Memory so that follow-up queries have context. Implementation: We will integrate the FastAPI scaffolding from 071.zip – including dependency setup (the Claude conversation provides a pip install list for FastAPI, PyTorch, Transformers, etc.) and example usage (e.g. a curl command hitting the API). The Pydantic input model PrajnaRequest and an output schema (for answer text, source list, and possibly a confidence score) will be defined. We will also incorporate the provided Svelte front-end component to ensure smooth communication (likely via REST for full answer and WebSocket for streaming).
2. Knowledge Base and Context Builder
The Context Builder is responsible for retrieving and compiling relevant information from Prajna’s internal knowledge bases to ground each answer. It draws from two primary sources, as described in the ChatGPT conversation plan:
Soliton Memory: the running memory of personal or conversational context (e.g. recent dialogue history, user-specific facts). This can include the last N user queries and Prajna’s answers, or any user profile/notes. It ensures continuity in multi-turn conversations and personalization. (In TORI’s architecture, Soliton Memory might be implemented as an in-memory store or database that logs interactions).
Concept Mesh: a knowledge graph built from the user’s accumulated content (documents, PDFs, webpages, images, videos, etc.), representing longer-term and structured knowledge. For example, documents are ingested and broken into nodes (concepts) with edges denoting relationships. The Concept Mesh might link topics extracted from PDFs or transcripts from videos. In practice, this acts as a vector-indexed knowledge base: each piece of content is associated with embeddings and metadata (source references). The concept graph structure can also allow symbolic traversal (e.g. finding connected concepts).
When a query comes in, the context builder does the following:
Query Understanding: It may perform lightweight NLP on the question to identify keywords, named entities, or a specified focus_concept (if the user provided one). This can guide retrieval (for instance, if focus_concept="quantum physics", prioritize that subgraph in Concept Mesh).
Similarity Search: The builder converts the query into an embedding vector (using the same embedding model used to index the knowledge base). It then finds the top-$k$ relevant pieces of text from the knowledge base. For vector search, we can use cosine similarity: for query $q$ with embedding $\phi(q)$ and a candidate document chunk $d$ with embedding $\phi(d)$, compute $\cos(\phi(q), \phi(d)) = \frac{\phi(q)\cdot\phi(d)}{|\phi(q)||\phi(d)|}$. The top $k$ documents with highest cosine similarity are retrieved【39†】. We might combine results from Soliton memory (recent chat history segments) and Concept Mesh (factual sources). If a knowledge graph is available, we can also perform a symbolic search: e.g. find nodes related to query terms, traverse connected nodes to gather facts. This can be useful for multi-hop questions.
Context Compilation: The selected pieces of knowledge are then compiled into a context passage. This may include brief summaries or raw text extracts, each annotated with a source identifier. For example: “… Einstein developed the theory of relativity in 1905【source1】.” The context builder ensures that all content in this context is from known sources (so that the LLM’s answer can later cite them). In other words, the LLM is constrained to “only speak from known context”, preventing open-ended hallucination【68†】. If the query is follow-up in a conversation, the context may also include a summary of the previous Q&A to maintain coherence.
Context Formatting: The context is inserted into a prompt template for the LLM. For instance, we might use a prompt like: “Using only the information below, answer the question. \n\nContext:\n{{retrieved text…}}\n\nQuestion: {{user query}}\nAnswer:”. This instruction warns the LLM not to go beyond provided facts. Citations can also be hinted (e.g. telling the LLM to include reference tags like [1], [2] corresponding to sources).
Mathematical note: The retrieval step can be seen as selecting a set $C = {c_1,\dots,c_k}$ from the knowledge base that maximizes some relevance score to query $q$. If we consider a probability view, one could define $P(c|q) \propto \exp(\text{sim}(q,c))$, and the builder effectively picks contexts that maximize this probability. More advanced retrieval might use a Bayesian approach: if we have a prior belief over sources, and an observation model of the query given a source, we could update beliefs on which source is most likely relevant (though in practice, embeddings do this implicitly). Integration: We will implement the Context Builder in the backend, possibly as a class or function (e.g. get_relevant_context(query, focus_concept)). We can use libraries like FAISS or scikit-learn (noting the Claude scaffold installed scikit-learn and numpy) to perform fast vector similarity search. The code scaffolding did not explicitly show the retrieval code, so we will create it – using the existing concept mesh data. The data from 071.zip suggests needing to integrate with existing TORI systems: e.g. if the Concept Mesh is stored in a database or file, the Context Builder must query that. If Soliton Memory is accessible via a REST API or direct call (Claude asked if Soliton Memory has an API or FFI), we will connect accordingly (e.g. call a memory service or read a local cache). For our prototype, we might assume they are accessible via Python (perhaps as simple as reading from a JSON or using an ORM if database).
3. LLM Answer Synthesis (Prajna Core)
Once context is gathered, the Prajna LLM module generates the answer. This module is essentially a local large language model that has been chosen or fine-tuned for TORI’s needs. The ChatGPT conversation mentioned using a local LLM (e.g. RWKV, LLaMA, etc.) to avoid external API calls and ensure privacy. We will load this model at startup (the Claude code scaffold provided a placeholder _load_my_model() method for this). Model Loading: We’ll integrate a model via HuggingFace Transformers or other frameworks. For example, if using a 7B LLaMA model, the code might do: tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('local-llama') and model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('local-llama', device_map='auto'). The scaffolding checked for transformers availability【40†】 and provides a spot to plug in MyCustomModel. We will replace MyCustomModel with actual loading logic of a pretrained model (ensuring it fits in memory or perhaps using quantization). The model’s parameters are denoted as $\theta$; initially $\theta_0$ are loaded from disk. Prompting and Generation: When a query arrives with compiled context $C$ and user question $Q$, we construct the prompt as described. The LLM then generates an answer $A$ by sampling from $P_\theta(A \mid C, Q)$. Formally, the model produces a sequence of tokens maximizing the conditional probability:
𝐴
∗
=
arg
⁡
max
⁡
𝐴
𝑃
𝜃
(
𝐴
∣
𝑄
,
𝐶
)
.
A 
∗
 =argmax 
A
​
 P 
θ
​
 (A∣Q,C).
In practice, this is done via auto-regressive sampling or beam search, possibly with temperature tuning. We may limit generation length (to ensure the answer is concise and fits UI). The model is instructed to include citations in the answer at appropriate points (since the context text contains source annotations, the LLM can learn to propagate those, e.g., output “【1】” where fact came from source1). This ensures traceability of each statement to the knowledge base. The generation module may incorporate internal reasoning if needed. For complex queries, one strategy is to allow the model to do chain-of-thought prompting (e.g., use a hidden scratchpad where the model works out intermediate steps). However, by default Prajna might not output the chain-of-thought to the user, only the final answer. If needed, we could implement an internal prompt like “Think step by step:” and then have the model produce reasoning followed by an answer. This can improve accuracy on multi-step problems, but we have to discard the reasoning before presenting the answer (or possibly use it in auditing). Another approach is tool use: if the query requires calculation or external lookup, Prajna could call a tool (like a calculator or database query) via a plugin. The architecture is designed to allow that in the future: e.g., the answer generation step could detect a formula and call a math solver. For now, we focus on using the context we have. Multimodal reasoning: If the query includes media (images, etc.), by the time it reaches the LLM, that media has been processed by a vision module (see Section 5) into text or structured data. The LLM can then reason about it. For example, if a user asks “What’s next to the cat in this image?” and an image is provided, the vision module might produce: “Image analysis: a cat is on a sofa, a pillow is next to the cat.” This text becomes part of the context $C$. The LLM can then answer: “The cat is next to a pillow【image†】.”. In this way, the LLM treats extracted visual info similarly to any text source. Potential Logical Formulation: Some reasoning may require symbolic logic or mathematics beyond pure language modeling. We can integrate a simple symbolic reasoning mechanism for specific cases. For instance, if the question is a logic puzzle, Prajna might internally represent it in a formal way (perhaps via a mini-prolog or custom logic evaluator). One idea is to let the LLM output a candidate formal representation which a solver can handle, then convert the result back to natural language. This is an optional extension for future, but worth noting as a strategy for certain complex reasoning tasks (like algebra, scheduling problems, etc.). Integration & Code: We will utilize the Claude conversation’s code scaffolds for this module. The conversation included a function async def _generate_my_model(self, prompt, max_tokens) – which we will implement to actually run the model’s .generate() function. We will handle streaming by chunking the output if using a library that supports it (or generate tokens in loops). The Claude scaffolding also mentioned methods _check_custom_patterns within the LLM class (though logically that belongs to audit, which we handle next). We will likely structure the code with a class like PrajnaEngine that holds the loaded model and has methods generate_answer(prompt) etc., and a separate AlienOverlay class for audits. The data from 071.zip (Claude’s outputs) gave code for an ask_prajna(question) and stream_prajna() – we’ll adapt those to interface the FastAPI endpoint and websockets for the UI.
4. Alien Overlay: Auditing and Alignment
After the LLM produces a raw answer, Prajna subjects this answer to an audit before finalizing it. This step, nicknamed the “Alien Overlay”, acts as an independent layer that checks the answer for factual consistency, safety, and coherence. Its purpose is to catch any mistakes or unwanted content the LLM might introduce, and either fix them or flag them. The audit consists of several sub-components: (a) Factual Consistency Check: The answer is compared against the retrieved context to detect any hallucinations or unsupported claims. Because the LLM was instructed to use only provided context, ideally everything it says is traceable. However, the LLM might still infer or fabricate minor details. The Alien Overlay can use a combination of techniques:
String overlap: Verify that each named entity or specific fact in the answer appears in the context. For example, if the answer states a date or a quote not found in context, that’s suspicious.
Embedding similarity: For each sentence in the answer, compute an embedding and compare with context embeddings. If a sentence has low similarity to all context chunks, it may be off-topic.
LLM verification (“Ghost” analysis): This is a more powerful approach where a second pass with an LLM (possibly the same model or a smaller verifier model) is done. For example, we can prompt: “Given the context and the answer, list any claims in the answer that are not supported by the context.” The model’s output (if any) would indicate hallucinations. Or we ask it: “Is the answer fully supported by the context? Answer YES or NO.” to get a quick check. This uses the LLM itself as a critic.
From these checks we derive a factuality score or flag. We can formalize a trust metric $T_{\text{fact}}$ as one minus the estimated probability of a hallucination. If the ghost analysis lists unsupported claims, $T_{\text{fact}}$ drops. We might assign a numeric score like: $T_{\text{fact}} = 1 - \frac{\text{#unsupported claims}}{\text{#total claims}}$ as a simple ratio, or use a trained classifier output for factual correctness probability. (b) Logical Consistency & Completeness: The overlay also evaluates the answer’s internal logic and whether it fully answers the user’s question. Here the “Ghost feedback” mechanism is useful. Ghost feedback involves generating implicit sub-questions or checking for gaps in reasoning【45†】. For example, if the user question was complex (“Compare X and Y on criteria Z”), the ghost might ensure the answer addressed all parts. Implementation-wise, we can prompt the model (in a hidden pass) to enumerate “ghost questions” – sub-questions the answer should have answered. If any are found unanswered, that indicates incompleteness. The overlay could then either augment the answer or at least attach a note that the answer might be partial. We might quantify a completeness score from 0 to 1. Indeed, in the Claude-provided code there was a concept of ghost_result['completeness_score'], suggesting a numeric rating of completeness was computed. A possible formula: $T_{\text{complete}} = 1 - \frac{\text{#ghost questions found}}{\text{#expected points}}$. If the answer addresses everything, no ghost questions remain, score ~1. (c) Safety and Policy Compliance: We must also ensure the answer does not contain disallowed or harmful content. Since Prajna is local, this is less about aligning with an external provider’s policy and more about user-defined safety (e.g. no hateful language, no privacy violations). We will incorporate rule-based filters and possibly a classifier:
Rule-based: The Claude scaffold included a _check_custom_patterns(sentence) stub, which for example flagged "suspicious_pattern" in the answer【32†】. We will implement real rules here: e.g., profanity lists, regex for sensitive data (like if the answer accidentally spills a password or personal data), etc. Each rule that triggers can add a flag (and possibly a severity score).
Classifier: We can fine-tune a small model to detect toxic or biased content, or use an open-source toxicity classifier. This gives a probability $P(\text{toxic}|\text{answer})$ or similar. We define a threshold above which we consider the answer unsafe.
These checks produce a safety score $T_{\text{safety}}$ (ranging 0-1). For instance, if any severe violation is found, $T_{\text{safety}}=0$ (fail). Aggregating Audit Results: The Alien Overlay combines the above into an overall trust score for the answer. For example, we can calculate a weighted sum:
𝑇
overall
=
𝑤
𝑓
𝑇
fact
+
𝑤
𝑐
𝑇
complete
+
𝑤
𝑠
𝑇
safety
,
T 
overall
​
 =w 
f
​
 T 
fact
​
 +w 
c
​
 T 
complete
​
 +w 
s
​
 T 
safety
​
 ,
with weights adjusting importance (perhaps factuality and safety are critical, completeness slightly less). Alternatively, the lowest score could be taken as the indicator (all must be high for full approval). If $T_{\text{overall}}$ is above a threshold, the answer is approved. If not, the system can take remedial action: either auto-regenerate the answer (perhaps with a prompt telling the LLM to avoid certain issues), or present the answer with a caution. For instance, if the only issue is incomplete information, Prajna might still answer but note “According to the provided sources, this is the available information.”. If there’s a factual contradiction, Prajna could choose to include a statement like “(The answer may contain unsupported content.)”. In extreme cases (e.g. user asked something that leads to disallowed content), the overlay might refuse: e.g. return an error or a polite refusal. Since this is an internal system, refusal would likely be rare and user-controlled. Logical Auditing Example: Suppose the query asks a multi-step math problem. The LLM produces an answer but the overlay’s ghost analysis finds an intermediate step was not explained. We could have Prajna’s answer include a brief explanation (if we allow it to output the reasoning) or simply lower the confidence. If ghost finds a potential logical leap, we might run a quick secondary calculation to verify (if possible). This is akin to unit testing the answer’s logic. Integration: The audit overlay will be implemented likely in a module (perhaps alien_overlay.py) separate from the main LLM. It can be called as audit_answer(answer, context) returning a result structure (flags, scores, maybe a corrected answer). We will use the placeholders from Claude’s code: e.g., fill in _check_custom_patterns with real rules. We also see hints in user files that an audit_answer function was considered. We will implement ghost analysis by calling the LLM with a special prompt (we can instantiate another instance of the model or reuse the main one in a different mode). To avoid high overhead, ghost analysis might be optional or only triggered for certain queries (user can enable “deep audit” mode).
5. Multimodal Query Handling
Prajna’s design extends beyond text – it can accept multimodal queries that include images or other media. The system integrates a Media Handler module in the pipeline, which processes non-text inputs and produces textual or structured data for the Context Builder and LLM. Image Input: When a user attaches an image with a question about it, Prajna uses a vision sub-module to analyze the image. This could be an image captioning model (e.g. BLIP-2) to get a general description, and/or an object detection model to list objects and their spatial relationships. The goal is to create a structured representation of the image that the LLM can reason over. Inspired by the Struct2D framework
arxiv.org
, we can generate a 2D scene representation: for example, a bird’s-eye view layout of objects with labels, or simply a textual list: “Objects: cat (at left), pillow (at right). The cat is next to the pillow on a sofa.” Providing spatial context in structured form helps the LLM answer spatial questions accurately. The Struct2D research shows that feeding LLMs structured visual inputs (like annotated images and metadata) significantly improves spatial reasoning without needing full 3D understanding
arxiv.org
. We will leverage that insight by including object positions or relations in the context text. If needed, we can also encode the image to a visual feature vector and have a multi-modal model process it (if our chosen LLM supports that), but the simpler approach is to translate visuals to text/graph form. Other Media: For audio queries, we would run speech-to-text (ASR) first so that the query becomes text for the pipeline. For video, perhaps extract key frames and treat them like multiple images or get a transcript if the question is about the video’s content. Essentially, all media is funneled into either text (descriptions, transcripts) or a set of facts that can be inserted into the context. The Concept Mesh likely already contains knowledge extracted from the user’s media (e.g. if user has a PDF, it’s parsed into text in the knowledge graph). But here we consider ad-hoc media that come with a query. Unified Processing: The API layer can accept a query with media by first passing the media file to the appropriate analyzer. We might design the API such that the user can upload an image and reference it in the query (e.g. {"user_query": "What is this diagram about?", "image": <binary or URL>}), or in a chat UI the image is attached. The backend will call e.g. an image_to_text(image) utility. The output (caption/analysis) will be appended to the context (with a tag like “ImageAnalysis: ...”). The rest of the pipeline then proceeds normally. We will ensure to cite the source of image-derived information in the answer, likely as “【image†】” or a descriptive tag, since the user’s own image is essentially the source. Example: User asks: “In the diagram (attached), is the voltage source connected in series with the resistor?” The image handler might identify circuit elements: “ImageAnalysis: The diagram shows a battery connected to a resistor and then to ground in a single loop.” The Context Builder may not need to retrieve anything else if the answer is directly in the image analysis. The LLM would answer confirming series connection, citing “(as seen in the diagram)”. The Alien Overlay might check consistency by ensuring the answer indeed reflects the described image. Note: Multimodal reasoning may also involve the LLM performing some spatial or visual reasoning. If needed, we could fine-tune the LLM on a small set of such tasks or use a specialized multimodal model. But initially, using separate vision models and injecting results as text is a practical approach.
6. Continuous Learning and Self-Improvement
To keep Prajna improving over time, we implement mechanisms for continuous learning from new data and feedback. This involves updating both the knowledge base and the model (or its strategies) in a safe, incremental way. Knowledge Base Updates: As the user provides new documents or as new information becomes available, the Concept Mesh can be continuously expanded. We will create an ingestion pipeline that processes new files (e.g. the user adds a PDF to their TORI system, or new chat logs are to be included). This pipeline would extract text (for PDFs, use OCR for images, etc.), update the concept graph with new nodes, and compute embeddings for new content to add to the vector index. Because the system is local, we can do this periodically or on-demand. Essentially, the knowledge base’s coverage grows, which immediately benefits Prajna’s ability to answer more questions. We ensure that every new piece of data is associated with source metadata (so new answers can cite them). Mathematically, if we consider the set of knowledge pieces as $K$, when new data $d_{new}$ arrives, we append it to $K$ and update the embedding store: $K := K \cup {d_{new}}$ and precompute $\phi(d_{new})$. This is an online update to our retrieval model. Many vector search libraries support adding new vectors in real-time. The effect is that the retrieval function $\text{Retrieve}(q)$ now has a larger pool to draw from, hopefully improving accuracy for queries on that new domain. Learning from Interactions: Beyond just adding knowledge, Prajna should learn from its experiences. Two key feedback signals are available: user feedback and self-evaluated performance.
User Feedback: The user might upvote/downvote answers, correct the AI, or provide the right answer if Prajna was wrong. We will capture this feedback. For instance, if the user says “Actually, that answer is wrong because XYZ,” we log that. This data can update the Soliton memory (so the system doesn’t repeat the mistake in the same session) and can be used offline to fine-tune the model or update the audit rules. A simple strategy is to treat it as supervised training data: the question and the user’s correct answer (or the fact that Prajna’s answer was wrong) become part of a growing dataset of QA pairs or “avoid this mistake” cases.
Ghost Self-Critique: The Ghost analysis from the audit stage can also be leveraged as learning signal. For example, if ghost consistently finds that Prajna’s answers miss a certain detail, we can adjust the prompt or the retrieval strategy. If a certain pattern of hallucination is detected, we can explicitly encode a rule or fine-tune the model on an example to stop that pattern.
Model Fine-Tuning: Periodically, we can improve the LLM itself by fine-tuning on collected data. Suppose over a month, the user has asked many questions and provided corrections on 10 of them; plus we’ve ingested open-source reasoning datasets (like those from the OpenThoughts project). We can then perform a fine-tuning run: combine the new QA pairs or reasoning examples with the original training data and update the model weights $\theta$. In a Bayesian perspective, we had a prior $P(\theta)$ (the original model distribution) and new evidence from data $D_{\text{new}}$ (the feedback). The posterior is $P(\theta | D_{\text{new}}) \propto P(D_{\text{new}}|\theta) P(\theta)$. Fine-tuning via gradient descent essentially seeks the $\theta$ that maximizes $P(D_{\text{new}}|\theta)$ while staying close to old $\theta$ (often achieved by using a small learning rate or regularization). For instance, one gradient update step would be:
𝜃
new
=
𝜃
old
−
𝜂
∇
𝜃
𝐿
(
𝐷
new
;
𝜃
old
)
,
θ 
new
​
 =θ 
old
​
 −η∇ 
θ
​
 L(D 
new
​
 ;θ 
old
​
 ),
where $\mathcal{L}$ is the loss (e.g. negative log-likelihood of the correct answers). Over time, these updates incorporate the new knowledge and corrections directly into the model. We will likely do this offline due to resource constraints, but since Prajna is modular, the model could even be swapped out for a newer fine-tuned one when ready (hot reload). Automated Self-Improvement: Taking inspiration from the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) concept
arxiv.org
, we can design a self-improvement loop for Prajna. The DGM paper demonstrates a system that iteratively modifies its own code and validates each change, drawing on evolutionary ideas
arxiv.org
. While Prajna may not rewrite its entire code, it can iteratively adjust certain strategies and test improvements. For example:
Prompt Evolution: The system can try variations of its prompt templates or retrieval parameters. It can A/B test these on a set of past queries to see if answers get more accurate or require less editing. This is analogous to the DGM sampling a new “agent” variant and testing it
arxiv.org
. If a prompt tweak consistently yields higher audit scores or user ratings, Prajna adopts that prompt going forward.
Agent Archives: We could maintain multiple versions of the LLM or subsystems (like different fine-tuned variants specialized in coding, math, etc.). Using a Darwinian approach, we keep an archive of candidate models/agents, periodically spawn a new one by, say, fine-tuning slightly differently or adjusting an algorithm, and test it on a benchmark of queries (possibly a synthetic set or difficult questions from the user). This is akin to growing a tree of diverse agents and selecting the best
arxiv.org
. All tests run in a sandbox environment so as not to affect the user with a bad variant (safety first). Over time, this open-ended exploration could yield significantly better performance. Empirical evidence for self-improvement shows large boosts in specific capabilities
arxiv.org
 – for instance, DGM improved coding performance dramatically through such iterative self-evolution. We can target domains relevant to the user’s needs (e.g., if the user often asks medical questions, the system might focus on improving its medical QA ability by training on medical texts and validating answers with known solutions).
OpenThoughts Data: The paper OpenThoughts: Data Recipes for Reasoning Models demonstrates that systematically improving the training data can yield state-of-the-art reasoning performance
arxiv.org
. We will apply this principle by curating new QA examples for areas where Prajna struggles. For example, if math word problems are a weakness, we generate or collect a set of math problems and their solutions to fine-tune on. The key is to use a controlled, systematic approach (OpenThoughts did 1,000+ controlled experiments on data generation
arxiv.org
). In our context, this could mean varying how we annotate context or how we format chain-of-thought, and measuring impact on correctness. We will also leverage their open-source datasets (if applicable) to strengthen Prajna’s reasoning foundation.
Adaptive Reasoning Depth: Another improvement informed by recent research is how we manage the “thinking steps” of the model. A paper on test-time scaling asks: “Does thinking more always help?” and finds that after a point, additional reasoning steps cause overthinking and reduced accuracy
arxiv.org
. Based on this, Prajna’s strategy will be to avoid blindly pushing the model to generate excessively long chains of reasoning. Instead, we implement adaptive stopping: the model might generate step-by-step thoughts but the Alien Overlay can monitor if the solution is converging. If further steps start to repeat or introduce contradictions (variance increases), it’s a signal to stop. Additionally, we can adopt the paper’s recommended approach of parallel thinking
arxiv.org
: generate multiple independent reasoning paths (say 5 separate attempts to answer) within the same time budget and then use a voting or consensus mechanism to pick the best answer. For example, Prajna can run the LLM 5 times with slight randomness (different seeds or prompting the model “Think differently if possible”) and gather 5 candidate answers. If 3 of them are identical and 2 differ, likely the majority is correct
arxiv.org
. This majority vote approach has been shown to boost accuracy by up to 20% compared to one prolonged “deep thought”
arxiv.org
. We will integrate this for complex questions: the Alien Overlay can request multiple drafts and either choose the most consistent answer or even merge insights from them.
Feedback Loops: All the above mechanisms form a feedback loop: user feedback and audit outcomes feed into model adjustments; model adjustments yield hopefully better answers, which then generate new feedback. To manage this responsibly, we will incorporate human oversight for any automated self-improvement that changes the model’s parameters or code (as DGM did with sandbox tests
arxiv.org
). For instance, Prajna could suggest a change (“I want to fine-tune on these 100 new QAs, expected improvement in science questions”) and a human (the developer or advanced user) can approve it. We also maintain a rollback option: if a new model version performs worse (e.g., user satisfaction drops), we revert to a previous version from the archive. This ensures stability while learning. In summary, Prajna’s continuous learning involves: expanding knowledge sources, refining the LLM via fine-tuning with new data, adjusting prompts/algorithms based on audits, and possibly employing a self-evolution framework to discover optimizations autonomously

. Over time, we expect Prajna to become more accurate, more knowledgeable, and better aligned with the user’s needs.
7. Module Responsibilities & Interconnections
To clarify how these components work together, here is a summary of key modules, their roles, and how they interface:
Frontend/UI: Collects user input (text or media), displays output. Communicates with backend via API (HTTP requests and WebSocket for streaming). Provides user feedback inputs (like thumbs-up/down) back to the system.
API Backend: Entry point on the server side. Receives requests, instantiates a Prajna Orchestrator (could be a controller function) which calls modules in sequence: Context -> LLM -> Audit -> returns answer. Also forwards conversation context to and from Soliton Memory storage.
Context Builder: Connected to Knowledge Base. It queries Soliton Memory (likely via an API or direct DB calls) for recent conversation data, and Concept Mesh (via an index or graph query) for relevant facts. It outputs a compiled context package (text with sources). Interfaces: it uses embedding models (could be static, or possibly the LLM embedding if available) and possibly graph traversal algorithms. The retrieved content is passed into the LLM prompt.
LLM Module (Prajna Engine): Encapsulates the loaded language model and generation logic. Input: the context-enriched prompt. Output: a draft answer (text with placeholder citations). It may call external tools if needed (though not in the initial implementation). This module is stateless per query (except using the loaded model which is stateful in memory). Interfaces: it interacts with the model’s GPU/CPU resources for heavy computation; it may utilize caching for responses if identical query is repeated.
Alien Overlay (Audit) Module: Takes the draft answer + context and runs checks. It interacts with possibly a smaller language model for ghost analysis or uses internal rules. It might call back into the LLM module for verification prompts (or use a lightweight model to save time). After analysis, it can call the LLM module again if regeneration is needed (e.g., “The answer had an unsupported part, so ask the LLM to regenerate with that constraint”). This iterative loop might run 0, 1 or many times depending on complexity (but we will limit to maybe one retry to avoid long delays). Interfaces: interacts with any custom classifiers (toxicity, etc.), the knowledge base (to double-check facts if needed), and the orchestrator to signal if the answer is final or needs re-generation.
Knowledge Base (Soliton & Concept Mesh): These are storage layers. Could be implemented as local files plus an index (for PDFs, etc.) and a memory store for chats. They are updated by ingestion processes and consulted by Context Builder. The knowledge base is not a single module but a subsystem; however, designing it to be queryable via uniform interface (e.g., KB.query(text) -> list of relevant passages) will simplify the Context Builder’s job.
Continuous Learning Daemon: This is not in the direct query path. It runs in the background or during idle times. It monitors logs (questions asked, answers given, feedback, audit results) and decides on actions like “ingest new data X”, “schedule model fine-tune tonight”, or “propose a new variant of the model”. It might have subcomponents like a Benchmark Evaluator (to test current performance on some tasks periodically), and a Trainer (to execute fine-tunes or to train a new classifier for audit if needed). This part can be implemented as a separate process or as part of the server that triggers at low-traffic times.
The interplay is as follows for a typical query: the Frontend sends query -> API -> Context Builder (uses KB) -> LLM (uses model) -> Alien Overlay (uses possibly model+rules+KB) -> API returns final answer to Frontend. After completion, the conversation and any feedback are logged; later the learning daemon may use that log. For integrating the 071.zip (Claude conversation) data into this system, we will directly use the provided scaffolding as the starting point for implementation:
The FastAPI server structure and the endpoints given will form the backbone of the API layer.
The Pydantic models like PrajnaRequest ensure the input includes everything needed (query, etc.) – we’ll extend it if needed for images (could be a separate endpoint or an upload then reference by ID).
The main logic that Claude generated (likely a start_prajna.py script and various module files) will be fleshed out: e.g., fill in the retrieval code (using possibly the hints from the conversation Qs about Soliton/Concept Mesh integration), implement the _load_my_model and _generate_my_model methods with actual model code (using PyTorch/Transformers as set up by pip install lines【27†】), and implement _check_custom_patterns properly (with our rules).
The frontend Svelte component from Claude’s output will be integrated into TORI’s UI. It likely shows how to call the API and stream responses. We will test it by simulating a few queries.
The Claude conversation also demonstrated a file operation (“add the words happy luck to this file”) which suggests that the environment for Claude had some file system agent abilities. This might not directly relate to Prajna’s core Q&A, but it indicates the AI can interface with local system if needed. In Prajna’s context, that could be used in continuous learning – e.g., writing new data to the knowledge base or reading a file on the fly if user asks “What’s in file XYZ?”. We can incorporate a file-access tool carefully, such that if a query explicitly requests the content of a local file, Prajna can open and read it (with user permission). This would effectively extend the knowledge base querying to real-time file reads (handy for answering “What is the content of this .txt I just gave you?”). The infrastructure for that (like list_allowed_directories in Claude’s log) shows it can be done securely by whitelisting directories【16†】. We will integrate such capability as an optional feature in Context Builder (treat an attached file as additional context).
8. Conclusion and Future Improvements
This technical plan lays out a comprehensive architecture for Prajna as a multimodal answer engine. To summarize the key points:
Prajna will be built as a modular pipeline with clear separation of concerns: retrieval, generation, and auditing. This modularity makes it easier to maintain and improve each part independently.
We leverage the user’s internal knowledge stores (Soliton memory and Concept Mesh) to ensure answers are grounded and cite those sources, fulfilling the requirement of retrieving and citing internal knowledge. The design inherently avoids unverified answers since context is required for generation【68†】.
We extend reasoning to multimodal inputs by introducing a vision/audio processing stage that feeds the LLM structured information, drawing from the latest research like Struct2D for spatial reasoning

.
We embed an auditing (Alien Overlay) mechanism that performs consistency checks, logical analysis (ghost feedback), and safety filtering, thus Prajna will self-audit its answers for factuality and coherence before responding. The use of parallel/ghost reasoning and majority vote strategies addresses the consistency in a mathematically grounded way (avoiding overthinking pitfalls

).
We outline a continuous learning paradigm where the system incrementally updates its knowledge and model. By incorporating user feedback and possibly automating some of the learning (inspired by open-ended self-improvement ideas
arxiv.org
), Prajna can get better with time. This includes fine-tuning on new data and exploring new configurations, with safeguards.
Going forward, some additional improvements could be explored:
Enhanced Symbolic Reasoning: Integrating a knowledge graph reasoning engine or a CAS (computer algebra system) for domains like math could further boost accuracy on specialized queries.
Scaling and Performance: As the knowledge base grows, more efficient retrieval (GPU-accelerated vector search, sharded indexes) will be important. The model itself could be switched for a larger one if local hardware improves, or a distillation approach could be used to keep responsiveness high.
User Personalization: Prajna can learn the user’s preferences (e.g., preferred citation style, depth of answer) over time and adjust output accordingly.
Feedback UX: Providing the user with an interface to easily correct or give feedback on answers (like highlighting a wrong fact and supplying the right one) can greatly help the continuous learning loop. We should design this interaction to be intuitive.
With the architecture and plan described, developing Prajna will involve implementing each component and ensuring they work in concert. By following this plan and utilizing the provided code scaffolds and research insights, we can create a robust multimodal answer engine that not only answers questions with cited knowledge, but also improves itself continuously, edging closer to an autonomous self-updating AI assistant.
