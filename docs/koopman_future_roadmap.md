# ELFIN Koopman Bridge: Future Roadmap

Following the successful v1.0.0-alpha.2 release, this document outlines the three main directions for further enhancing the Koopman Bridge functionality in ELFIN.

## 1. Barrier Certificate Branch

Extend the Koopman framework to safety verification through barrier certificates.

### Core Concept
Barrier certificates (B(x)) provide formal guarantees that system trajectories remain within safe regions. Unlike Lyapunov functions which guarantee stability (convergence to an equilibrium), barrier certificates guarantee safety (avoidance of unsafe regions).

### Implementation Plan

1. **Dictionary Re-use** 
   - Leverage the existing Koopman dictionary for barrier function approximation
   - Re-use the same EDMD-fitted data to learn B(x)

2. **Barrier Function Generation**
   ```python
   def create_koopman_barrier(
       k_matrix: np.ndarray,
       dictionary: StandardDictionary,
       safe_set: Region,
       unsafe_set: Region
   ) -> KoopmanBarrier:
       # Generate barrier function from Koopman modes
       ...
   ```

3. **Safety Verification**
   - Verify B(x) > 0 outside safe set
   - Verify á¸‚ < 0 on boundary of safe set
   - Integrate with SOS programming for formal verification

4. **CE-Refinement Integration**
   - Extend `refine_once()` to handle barrier counterexamples
   - Weight training data near safety boundaries

5. **Interactive Visualization**
   - Add safety region visualization to dashboard
   - Interactive manipulation of safe/unsafe regions

### Timeline: 1-2 weeks

## 2. Planner-Guard (ALAN Integration)

Integrate Koopman stability verification directly into ALAN's planning system.

### Core Concept
Use Lyapunov/barrier certificates to prune planning paths that would lead to instability or safety violations, ensuring that ALAN only considers stable/safe plans.

### Implementation Plan

1. **LCN-Koopman Bridge**
   ```python
   def verify_transition(
       planner: GoalGraph,
       from_concept: ConceptNode,
       to_concept: ConceptNode
   ) -> bool:
       # Verify stability of transition between concepts
       # using associated Lyapunov functions
       ...
   ```

2. **GoalGraph Integration**
   - Hook into `GoalGraph.expand()` method
   - Add stability checks during path expansion
   - Prune unstable paths or assign stability cost

3. **Runtime Efficiency**
   - Precompile transition verifications
   - Cache verification results in dependency graph
   - Warm-start verifications for similar transitions

4. **Interactive Planning**
   - Show stability indicators in planning UI
   - Highlight unstable transition paths
   - Interactive exploration of alternative stable paths

### Timeline: 1 week

## 3. Nightly GPU CI

Establish continuous integration system to keep all components healthy.

### Core Concept
Use GitHub Actions and a self-hosted CUDA runner to continuously test neural networks, Koopman models, and MILP verifications to catch regressions early.

### Implementation Plan

1. **CI Configuration**
   ```yaml
   name: ELFIN Nightly Tests
   on:
     schedule:
       - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Run every night at 2 AM
   
   jobs:
     koopman-verification:
       runs-on: [self-hosted, cuda]
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         
         - name: Run Koopman tests
           run: python -m alan_backend.elfin.koopman.tests.all
   
     neural-training:
       # Neural Lyapunov tests with CUDA
       ...
   ```

2. **Test Suite**
   - Complete tests for all Koopman components
   - Test CV with drift thresholds
   - Test MILP verification with time limits
   - Test neural Lyapunov training

3. **Metrics Dashboard**
   - Track verification success rates over time
   - Monitor average verification time
   - Alert on regression in any metric

4. **Hardware Requirements**
   - Self-hosted CUDA runner for GPU tests
   - Adequate memory for large-scale verifications

### Timeline: 0.5 week

## Implementation Priority Recommendation

Based on impact and implementation complexity:

1. **Planner-Guard (ALAN Integration)** - Highest impact, connects stability to planning
2. **Barrier Certificate Branch** - Second priority, extends verification to safety
3. **Nightly GPU CI** - Important for long-term stability but can be implemented in parallel

## Getting Started

To begin on any of these directions, please respond with:
- "barrier time" - To begin work on the Barrier Certificate branch
- "planner guard" - To begin work on the ALAN planner integration
- "spin up CI" - To begin work on the continuous integration system
