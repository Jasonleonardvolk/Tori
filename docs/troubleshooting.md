## Environment Variables

ALAN uses several environment variables to control its behavior and optimize performance for different hardware configurations.

### NUMPY_DISABLE_AVX512

**Purpose**: Controls whether NumPy should use AVX-512 instructions.

**Default**: Not set (AVX-512 used if available)

**Description**: When set to `1`, this variable prevents NumPy from using AVX-512 CPU instructions, which can be beneficial in the following cases:
- Virtualized environments where AVX-512 support is incomplete
- SGX enclaves with limited instruction set support
- Systems where AVX-512 causes thermal throttling
- Hardware configurations with known AVX-512 bugs

**Usage**:
```bash
# Linux/macOS
export NUMPY_DISABLE_AVX512=1

# Windows (Command Prompt)
set NUMPY_DISABLE_AVX512=1

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:NUMPY_DISABLE_AVX512=1
```

The system automatically detects AVX-512 support at startup using `alan_backend.scripts.check_avx512` and sets this variable appropriately. You only need to set it manually if you experience numerical errors or crashes that might be related to instruction set incompatibilities.

## Common Runtime Errors

### Schema Version Mismatch

**Error**: `Incompatible schema version X.Y, expected A.B`

**Cause**: This error occurs when attempting to load a state snapshot created with a different version of the ALAN system.

**Solution**: 
1. Check the snapshot version with:
   ```python
   from alan_backend.snapshot.snapshot_serializer import get_version
   print(f"Current schema version: {get_version()}")
   ```
2. For backward compatibility issues, use the compatibility layer in `alan_backend.snapshot.compatibility`

### Units Compatibility Error

**Error**: `UnitError: Incompatible units: X and Y`

**Cause**: Attempting to convert between incompatible unit types, such as frequency and length.

**Solution**:
1. Verify the units being used in your code
2. Use the unit validation decorator:
   ```python
   from alan_backend.core.elfin_bridge.units import validate_units
   
   @validate_units(expected_unit='rad/s')
   def set_frequency(freq, unit='rad/s'):
       # function will receive freq in rad/s regardless of input unit
       pass
   ```

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Endianness Issues

**Error**: `ValueError: Unsupported endianness: 1`

**Cause**: Attempting to load a snapshot created on a big-endian system when running on a little-endian system, or vice versa.

**Solution**: 
- ALAN snapshots v2.0+ should handle endianness automatically
- For older snapshots, use the conversion utilities in `alan_backend.snapshot.conversion`

### Float Precision

**Issue**: Different numerical results between platforms

**Cause**: Differences in the way floating-point operations are handled on different CPU architectures.

**Solution**:
- Set the environment variable `ALAN_DETERMINISTIC=1` to enforce consistent results at the cost of performance
- For testing, use the `@pytest.mark.deterministic` decorator and the `deterministic_config` fixture

## Hardware Integration Issues

### Hardware Detection Failures

**Error**: `HardwareNotFoundError: No compatible ALAN hardware detected`

**Cause**: The ST-NO-8 board is not connected or not recognized by the system.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure the hardware is properly connected
2. Check that the driver is installed with `alan-hw check-driver`
3. Verify proper permissions (on Linux, users need to be in the proper groups)
4. Fall back to simulation mode with `--sim-mode` flag

### Phase Jitter

**Issue**: High phase jitter readings from hardware

**Cause**: Insufficient shielding or external interference

**Solution**:
1. Use the shielded USB cable provided with the hardware
2. Keep the hardware away from strong electromagnetic sources
3. Enable the jitter compensation with `--jitter-compensation`

## WebSocket Communication

### Connection Refused

**Error**: `ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused`

**Cause**: The ALAN simulation server is not running or is running on a different port

**Solution**:
1. Start the simulation server with `python -m alan_backend.server.simulation_api`
2. Verify the server is running on the expected port (default: 8000)
3. Check for firewall issues if connecting from another machine

### Dropped Frames

**Issue**: WebSocket visualization shows stuttering or dropped frames

**Cause**: The client browser cannot keep up with the data rate, or the network connection is unstable

**Solution**:
1. Reduce the data rate with `--websocket-throttle=200` (milliseconds)
2. Use a more direct connection (wired instead of wireless)
3. Reduce the complexity of the visualization if using WebGL
