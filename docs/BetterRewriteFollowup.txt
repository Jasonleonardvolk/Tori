Gap Analysis Between Foundational and Better MCP Server Drafts

MCP Server Architecture Drafts – Comparative Analysis and Recommendations
Core Components Missing from Better Rewrite (from Foundational)
Modular Service Layers: The original “Foundational MCP Server Architecture” delineated distinct services (e.g. separate orchestration engine, tool integration services, memory store, policy service), ensuring each had a focused responsibility. In contrast, the “Better Rewrite” omits or blurs some of these layers. This is a significant omission: without clear service separation, responsibilities get tangled and the system loses modularity and maintainability. For example, the Foundational draft likely described dedicated microservices or modules for tasks like knowledge retrieval, reasoning, and policy enforcement, whereas the rewrite consolidates logic without explaining how these concerns are isolated.
Agent Workflow & Control Flow: The Foundational draft detailed the end-to-end agent flow – how an LLM-based agent moves through various steps from receiving a user query to producing a result. It likely charted each phase (intent parsing, planning, tool invocation, result aggregation, response generation) and how data flows between components at each step. The Better Rewrite provides no such explicit workflow. The absence of a described control flow is problematic: it’s unclear how the components interact over time or how multi-step reasoning is orchestrated. In the MCP context, there is a well-defined sequence (initialization, capability discovery, invocation, execution, response, etc.
philschmid.de
philschmid.de
) that should be reflected in the architecture. By not mapping out the agent’s lifecycle, the rewrite leaves readers guessing how requests traverse the system and how decisions are made at each stage.
Data Orchestration Mechanism: The Foundational draft addressed data orchestration – how data and intermediate results are managed and passed between services (perhaps via an event bus, shared context object, or message queues). It may have described a coordinator or orchestrator service responsible for routing data (e.g. sending the LLM’s tool requests to the correct service and merging results back). The Better Rewrite under-specifies this aspect. There’s no clear description of how information flows or where aggregation happens. For instance, if one module fetches information from a database and another generates text, the rewrite doesn’t state how those results combine. This omission could lead to confusion or architectural gaps, since orchestrating data pipelines is critical in a multi-component system. Without an explicit data flow or orchestration layer, it’s uncertain how consistency, timing, and data transformations are handled across components.
Policy/Compliance Layer: The original architecture explicitly separated the policy enforcement (content filtering, compliance checks, guardrails) from the core logic. Likely, a dedicated policy service or module was responsible for moderating requests and responses (applying company policies or ethical guidelines) before they reach the LLM or the user. In the Better Rewrite, this separation is missing or unclear – there’s little mention of how content policy or safety checks are applied. This is a core omission: safety and policy enforcement should be a first-class component, not an afterthought. The lack of a distinct policy layer means the rewrite doesn’t explain where filtering or oversight occurs, which is risky. Modern AI architectures (e.g. enterprise AI orchestrators) strongly emphasize guardrails and audit trails
itential.com
itential.com
, so omitting this in the rewrite leaves a crucial piece undefined.
Memory and Knowledge Integration: The Foundational draft likely discussed how the system maintains and accesses long-term knowledge – for example, integration with a vector database, knowledge graph, or memory store to allow the agent to remember facts or past interactions. It may have included a module for concept or memory graph access, ensuring the agent can retrieve context beyond a single session. The Better Rewrite makes little mention of this kind of persistent memory or knowledge store. If the agent is meant to have a “conceptual memory” or retain learnings (as might be implied by the name MCP:kaizen), the rewrite doesn’t specify how that is achieved. Omitting a memory integration means both drafts risk a design where the AI agent has no mechanism to improve or reference past knowledge over time. In summary, the rewrite stripped away the explicit data memory/cache layer that was present in the foundational plan, thereby losing clarity on how the system will handle knowledge retention and lookup.
Entirely Missing Elements in Both Drafts
Beyond comparing the two drafts, there are critical capabilities that neither draft covers, which should be included in a robust MCP architecture:
Security & Access Control Orchestration: Both drafts lack details on security architecture. There’s no mention of how authentication, authorization, encryption, or network security are handled. For a system that interfaces with possibly sensitive data and powerful AI tools, not specifying a security layer is a glaring gap. Best practices (e.g. Brett’s MCP Gateway architecture) include a secure gateway or proxy that enforces auth, intrusion detection, and encrypted tunneling for MCP traffic
arxiv.org
. The final design should incorporate security orchestration – perhaps an API Gateway or dedicated security service that manages credentials, API keys for tools, user access rights, and monitors for anomalous activity. Additionally, a threat model should be considered (as Brett (2025) suggests
arxiv.org
) to identify and mitigate potential security risks. None of this appears in either draft.
Concept Memory Graph Integration: Neither draft references integration with a concept memory graph or a dynamic knowledge base. Given that modern AI agents benefit from a memory of concepts and relationships (to avoid repeating mistakes and to accumulate knowledge), this is an important capability to add. A concept memory graph could be a semantic network or knowledge graph that the MCP servers query and update. It would allow MCP:kaizen to truly implement “continuous improvement” by recording new insights and MCP:celery to have access to domain knowledge. The final architecture should define how a memory graph or long-term memory store is interfaced – for example, via a dedicated service that the agent can query as a resource or tool. Without this, both drafts describe fairly static systems that don’t learn from past interactions.
Phase-Aware Task Orchestration: Both drafts assume a straightforward request-response flow and don’t address orchestrating an agent’s reasoning in multiple phases. Advanced AI agents often operate in phases or loops (e.g. plan→act→reflect cycles, or separate “thinking” vs “execution” phases). There is no mechanism described for the system to manage such phased operation or iterative planning. This is a missed opportunity to incorporate more sophisticated orchestration. For instance, research on continuous reasoning in agents suggests moving beyond a fixed think-plan-act loop to a more dynamic approach
arxiv.org
. A phase-aware orchestrator could monitor the agent’s progress, trigger different phases (planning, action, verification, re-planning), and allocate resources accordingly. Including this would enable MCP:kaizen/celery to handle complex multi-step tasks more reliably (e.g. first gather requirements, then execute tools, then verify results, etc.). Neither draft currently covers how an agent might carry state or strategy from one step to the next beyond a single operation.
Auto-Repair & Self-Healing Capabilities: Real-world systems need resilience. Neither draft specifies how the system detects and handles failures or errors in the pipeline. For example, what if a tool service crashes, or an LLM returns a malformed answer, or a network call times out? Auto-repair mechanisms are completely missing. A production-grade MCP architecture should include self-healing patterns – for example, a supervisor process that restarts failed services, retry logic for transient errors, circuit breakers for unstable components, and fallback behaviors if the AI output doesn’t pass validation. Without auto-repair, the system could easily get stuck or require constant human intervention to reset. Both drafts should be enhanced with an error-handling strategy describing how the system recovers from failures (whether by re-trying operations, switching to alternate services, or notifying an operator).
Integration with TORI Concept Filtering Pipeline: The user has a newly deployed concept filtering pipeline (TORI), but neither draft mentions how it will be integrated. This pipeline likely processes content to filter or flag certain concepts (perhaps for safety, compliance, or categorization). Not integrating it means the current architecture designs are ignoring an available safety/control mechanism. The final architecture should explicitly weave TORI into the workflow – for instance, incoming user prompts might be run through TORI for screening and concept tagging before the agent acts on them, and the agent’s outputs could be filtered afterwards to remove or alter any disallowed content. This could be implemented by a policy filter service that calls TORI as an API. By omitting this, the drafts miss a critical piece of the environment. Incorporating TORI will enforce policy separation (which the rewrite already underspecified) and ensure the MCP:kaizen and MCP:celery outputs align with the organization’s content rules.
Observability and Audit: Both drafts are silent on how the system will be monitored and audited. In a complex multi-component architecture, it’s vital to have observability – logging, metrics, tracing – to understand what the agent is doing and why. Neither draft describes any logging of agent actions, user queries, tool invocations, or performance metrics. Likewise, audit trails (for later review of decisions the AI made) are not mentioned. This is a critical omission, especially for enterprise or safety-critical deployments. External practices underscore the importance of auditability (e.g. noting that letting AI run with “no guardrails, no audit trail” is a recipe for chaos
itential.com
). The final design should include an observability plan: for example, a centralized logging service where each module reports key events, correlation IDs to trace a single user query through the system, and perhaps an Inspector or debug interface. (Notably, the Anthropic MCP ecosystem provides an MCP Inspector tool for debugging servers
modelcontextprotocol.io
 – our architecture should ensure compatibility with such tooling for easier testing and debugging.)
Comparative Notes vs External MCP Models
It’s useful to compare the above drafts (and needed improvements) with known MCP architecture patterns and best practices from industry and academia:
Anthropic’s MCP Reference Architecture: Anthropic (who introduced the Model Context Protocol) defines a clear client–host–server architecture. In their model, the Host (e.g. the AI application or agent container) manages multiple clients and orchestrates everything, enforcing security and isolating concerns
modelcontextprotocol.io
. The Clients handle communication with each external MCP server, and each Server provides a focused capability (tool or data access) without seeing the whole application context
modelcontextprotocol.io
modelcontextprotocol.io
. This separation is highly relevant. The Foundational draft’s approach to separate services aligned more closely with this philosophy than the rewrite does. For instance, Anthropic’s design says the host handles complex orchestration and security, while servers remain simple and specialized
modelcontextprotocol.io
. Our architecture should emulate these principles: maintain a clear boundary between the orchestration layer (which could be analogous to the host in Anthropic’s terms, possibly MCP:celery if it’s the orchestrator) and the specialized capability providers (which could be individual microservices or MCP:kaizen if it focuses on a specific set of tools/knowledge). Additionally, Anthropic emphasizes security boundaries (each server only gets minimum context, host controls cross-server interactions)
modelcontextprotocol.io
 – a reminder that our design should ensure, for example, that a tool plugin can’t accidentally access data it shouldn’t, and that the core orchestrator can enforce permissions.
MCP Gateway Architecture (Brett 2025): Ivo Brett’s work on “Simplified and Secure MCP Gateways for Enterprise AI” provides a reference architecture focused on security and enterprise integration
arxiv.org
. Brett introduces an MCP Gateway that sits in front of MCP servers to handle authentication, intrusion detection, and secure tunneling of traffic
arxiv.org
. The gateway model also includes a threat model mapping and suggests best practices for self-hosting MCP servers without exposing internal infrastructure. Comparing this to our drafts, it’s clear neither draft included such a security gateway or comprehensive security model. Incorporating Brett’s ideas would enhance our architecture: we could deploy an MCP Gateway component that all clients (LLM agents) communicate through when accessing MCP:kaizen or MCP:celery. This gateway would enforce login/auth tokens, filter out malicious requests (e.g. rate-limit or block injection attempts), and possibly allow safe exposure of our MCP services to external callers without risking the core servers. Essentially, Brett’s approach underscores that security must be layered on top of MCP servers, which is something our current design needs to adopt. The gateway concept also simplifies integration – e.g. multiple MCP servers can register with one gateway, and clients just connect to the gateway, which is relevant if MCP:kaizen and MCP:celery are two servers providing different capabilities.
Itential’s MCP Orchestration Layer: A recent example from industry is Itential’s MCP Server, which is positioned as a safe orchestration and data integration layer for AI in network automation. Itential’s architecture highlights the need for guardrails, policy enforcement, and data normalization when AI agents perform actions in an enterprise network
itential.com
itential.com
. Their MCP server acts as a “data plane for AI,” meaning it sits between AI agents and the environment, translating and regulating requests and responses in a structured way
itential.com
. Key takeaways for our design: we should treat our MCP servers not just as dumb pipes, but as an orchestration layer that validates and transforms data. Itential’s emphasis on audit trails and change management (e.g. ensuring an AI-suggested firewall rule doesn’t bypass human change control
itential.com
) suggests our architecture should include similar workflow checks. For MCP:kaizen/celery, this might mean integrating with workflow engines or having approval steps for certain actions. It also means the architecture should be able to log and roll back actions if needed. The current drafts didn’t mention these enterprise features, but adopting them would make the system much more robust for real-world use. In summary, external models like Itential’s remind us to incorporate governance in the design – not just achieving functionality, but doing so in a controlled, observable, and reversible manner.
Academic Patterns and Emerging Practices: The MCP ecosystem is evolving, and there are experimental architectures that could inspire enhancements. For example, Wang et al. (2025) propose integrating Continuous Thought Machines (CTM) with MCP for robotics, effectively creating a dynamic reasoning loop rather than a static plan-act sequence
arxiv.org
. This shows a trend toward architectures that allow AI agents to iteratively refine their plans and handle unexpected situations by continuously thinking. While our context is different, the idea of a more flexible agent loop could be applied via the phase-aware orchestration mentioned earlier. Another practice is the use of developer tools like the MCP Inspector (from Anthropic)
modelcontextprotocol.io
, which indicates our architecture should be debug-friendly – e.g. support hot-swapping a local MCP server instance into a running system for testing, or exposing internal state for debugging. Open-source MCP servers (as catalogued in awesome-mcp-servers lists) also show patterns like using standard transports (Stdio, HTTP/SSE as per MCP spec) and keeping server logic stateless and simple. Ensuring our MCP:kaizen and celery align with these patterns (stateless where possible, standard protocol compliance, easy to spin up or replace) will make them easier to maintain and integrate. In short, looking at external references, our design would benefit from stronger security/gateway layers, clearer separation of roles (host vs server), robust policy enforcement and auditing, and support for iterative reasoning and debugging – many of which are not fully realized in the current drafts.
Recommendations to Finalize MCP Architecture (MCP:kaizen & MCP:celery)
To build MCP:kaizen and MCP:celery successfully, we recommend the following adjustments and additions to the architecture:
Reintroduce and Clarify Core Components: Restore the explicit components from the Foundational draft that were lost in the rewrite. Define each service/module in the architecture with a clear role. For example:
Orchestrator/Controller – a central process that manages the sequence of actions (this could correspond to MCP:celery if it’s meant to coordinate tasks).
Tool/Integration Services – individual modules or MCP servers that interface with external systems (APIs, databases, etc.), each focused on a domain (one could imagine MCP:kaizen or sub-components of it acting as these if kaizen is an ensemble of tools).
Memory/Knowledge Store – a service for long-term data (vector DB or concept graph) that all other components can query for context.
Policy Enforcement Service – a dedicated module that will use the TORI pipeline (and other rules) to filter or approve content.
Client/Host Interface – the layer through which the user or AI host interacts with this system (for instance, if there’s a chat UI or a host application, define how it connects to MCP:celery/kaizen clients).
By clearly defining these in the final architecture diagram and description, you ensure each concern is isolated. This aligns with the MCP design principle of “clear separation enables maintainable code”
modelcontextprotocol.io
. It will prevent the rewrite’s issue of blending responsibilities.
Document End-to-End Agent Flow: Include a detailed sequence diagram or description of the agent’s journey through the system. Start from when a user query arrives at the host or gateway, then show how it goes through intent interpretation, possibly planning, tool invocation via MCP:celery/kaizen, gathering results, applying filters, and finally returning a response. Make sure to incorporate the MCP handshake and invocation steps (capability discovery, etc.) as part of this flow if relevant
philschmid.de
philschmid.de
. This will clarify how MCP:kaizen and MCP:celery interact: for instance, if MCP:celery is the orchestrator, it might sequentially call MCP:kaizen or other MCP servers as tools, then compile the answer. By laying out the flow, you also identify where each component (from the previous point) comes into play. The final architecture should leave no ambiguity about “what happens next” at each stage of processing. This will make the design easier to implement and debug because everyone can follow the logical progression of a task.
Implement a Security Gateway & Access Controls: It’s strongly recommended to introduce a security gateway in front of the MCP servers. This could be an API Gateway or a lightweight proxy that all client calls go through (possibly using an approach like Brett’s MCP Gateway
arxiv.org
). The gateway should handle:
Authentication & Authorization: Only allow requests from verified clients or users. Integrate with your auth system (tokens, API keys, etc.) so that, for example, MCP:celery doesn’t accept arbitrary requests without proper credentials.
TLS/Encryption: Ensure all communications, especially if MCP:kaizen/celery are distributed or cloud-hosted, are over secure channels.
Rate Limiting & Intrusion Detection: Prevent misuse by limiting how fast requests can be made and flagging unusual patterns (too many requests, known malicious payloads, etc.).
Secure Tunneling for Remote Components: If any part of the system runs in an untrusted network or if users connect from outside, use the gateway for secure tunneling instead of exposing internal services directly
arxiv.org
.
Auditing: Have the gateway log all access attempts and actions for audit trail.
By adding this layer, the final architecture will address the previously missing security orchestration. It essentially wraps MCP:kaizen and MCP:celery in a protective layer. Design-wise, show the gateway in your diagram as the entry point for any external interaction. In practice, this means any host or client will connect to the gateway (not directly to MCP:celery/kaizen) to initiate sessions. Inside the system, you can still have open communication, but even internal components should use secure channels if they span trust boundaries. This change will greatly harden the deployment and is aligned with enterprise best practices for AI services.
Integrate the TORI Filtering Pipeline at Key Points: Incorporate TORI into the architecture for content filtering and concept tagging. Two primary integration points are recommended:
Pre-processing user input: Before a user query or command is handed to the LLM or used by MCP:celery for planning, run it through TORI. This can flag disallowed content or sensitive topics and either sanitize or reject the request according to policy. The policy service (mentioned above) would handle this logic – for instance, if TORI indicates the query contains confidential data request, the policy module might block it or route it for special approval.
Post-processing AI output: After the LLM or agent generates a response (and possibly after it uses tools via MCP:kaizen), use TORI again to scan the outgoing content. This ensures no policy violations (e.g. revealing internal secrets or offensive content) in the final answer. The policy service could modify or redact the response if necessary, or even ask the LLM to rephrase if something is problematic.
By threading TORI in this way, you enforce policy separation clearly: all content flows through a filter that’s outside the core logic. Make sure to update the architecture docs to show a “Policy Filter (TORI)” component connected wherever data enters or leaves the LLM. This addresses both the missing policy layer and leverages the new TORI system effectively.
Add a Concept Memory/Knowledge Graph Module: To provide the system with long-term memory and contextual knowledge, integrate a Concept Memory Graph (or similar knowledge base) into the design. For example, have a Knowledge Service that the agent can query via MCP (perhaps MCP:kaizen could include this, or it’s a separate MCP server the orchestrator calls). This service could interface with a graph database or vector store containing facts, historical conversations, user preferences, etc. Define how this memory is updated – maybe MCP:kaizen (if it’s oriented towards continuous learning) takes new information from interactions and updates the graph in the background. Also define how the agent uses it – e.g. at the start of a session, the orchestrator might retrieve relevant facts from the graph to inject into the context. Including this in the architecture ensures MCP:kaizen and celery aren’t operating in a vacuum each time; they can accumulate and leverage knowledge, which was missing in both drafts. On the diagram, you might represent this as a “Memory/Graph DB” with connections to whichever component will query it (likely the orchestrator or a dedicated retrieval component).
Introduce Phase-Aware Orchestration (Planner/Manager): Equip the architecture with a component that can handle multi-phase reasoning. This could be a Planning Module that sits within MCP:celery (if celery is the orchestrator) or alongside it. Its job is to break complex tasks into sub-tasks and manage the sequence (a bit like a conductor ensuring the agent doesn’t try to do everything in one go). For instance, if a user asks a complicated question, the planner might first instruct the agent to search for information (tool use phase), then have the agent draft an answer (writing phase), then maybe verify the answer (verification phase). Technically, this could be implemented by having the LLM prompt itself in different modes, or by an external logic that decides which MCP server to call next. The architecture should allow looped interactions: e.g. the LLM (via the host) can call back into MCP:celery multiple times in a conversation – essentially enabling an iterative loop instead of a single-turn operation. Diagram-wise, you might illustrate a loop or a state machine in the orchestrator. The key is to articulate in the final design that the system supports dynamic sequences of actions rather than a fixed request/response. This will cover the advanced use cases and aligns with modern research trends that aim for more autonomous, self-reflective agents.
Implement Error Handling and Auto-Recovery: Update the architecture to explicitly handle failures. This involves both design and implementation considerations:
Each service should report errors back to the orchestrator (e.g. if a tool call fails, MCP:kaizen returns an error code). Define how the orchestrator reacts: maybe it retries the call, or tries an alternate service if available, or gracefully informs the user of the failure.
Introduce timeouts and circuit breakers: if a sub-process hangs or consistently fails, the orchestrator should stop waiting and either reset that component or skip that step.
Consider a Watchdog component or use orchestration frameworks (like Kubernetes health checks or a supervisor process) to automatically restart services that crash. If MCP:kaizen is a process that might occasionally crash due to a bad input, having it auto-restart and re-register is important for high availability.
Log and escalate critical failures: for example, if even after retries a crucial operation fails, the system could alert a human operator or switch to a backup mode (maybe a simpler response).
In the documentation, it would help to include a small section “Failure Modes & Recovery” explaining these strategies. This addition will make the architecture far more resilient. It’s much better to plan these now than to deal with outages later.
Enhance Observability (Logging, Monitoring, Debugging): As neither draft touched on this, explicitly add an Observability stack to the architecture. This can include:
A centralized Logging service or just an agreement that all components will emit structured logs to a common sink (e.g. use ELK stack or cloud logging).
Metrics collection (perhaps each microservice exports metrics like number of requests, latency, errors, which can feed into a dashboard).
Tracing: use a distributed tracing system so that a user query can be traced across MCP:celery -> MCP:kaizen -> any other microservice, giving a timeline of what happened. This is invaluable for debugging complex issues.
An Inspector interface for developers: ensure that during development you can attach the MCP Inspector tool
modelcontextprotocol.io
 or a similar debugging UI to observe the interactions between the LLM and your MCP servers. This might mean running a local instance of MCP:kaizen and connecting the inspector to it, which should be feasible if you stick to MCP standards. In the final writeup, mention how one can test the system (which reassures stakeholders that the design is testable and transparent).
By designing with observability in mind, you’ll catch issues early and make life easier for everyone maintaining the system. It also ties back into the guardrails point – with proper logs and audits, you can conduct compliance checks (e.g. review what the AI did last week, which is important if something goes wrong).
Leverage External Patterns for MCP:kaizen and MCP:celery: Finally, tailor the architecture to the specific goals of MCP:kaizen and MCP:celery. If these are two different MCP servers you plan to build, clarify their interaction. For instance, if MCP:celery is intended as the “workhorse orchestrator” (the name hints at the Celery task queue, suggesting task orchestration), then design MCP:celery as the central coordinator that delegates tasks to other services (including MCP:kaizen). If MCP:kaizen is focused on continuous improvement or learning, perhaps it could be responsible for analyzing outcomes (like evaluating answers, updating the knowledge base, optimizing prompts). In that case, MCP:kaizen might run as a background agent that periodically refines the concept memory graph or monitors performance metrics and suggests improvements. Ensure the architecture supports this by allowing feedback loops from MCP:kaizen’s analyses back into MCP:celery’s decision-making (for example, if Kaizen identifies a better strategy for a certain query, Celery’s planner could incorporate that next time). If, on the other hand, both are more straightforward tool-providing servers, then ensure they are modular so they can be used independently or together. The recommendation here is to be explicit about each server’s purpose and design the interfaces between them. Document how MCP:celery and MCP:kaizen communicate (if they do) – possibly via MCP calls or a shared database. Also, consider future expansion: if new MCP servers are added to the ecosystem, the architecture should accommodate them easily (following the Anthropic principle of composability where multiple servers can be combined seamlessly
modelcontextprotocol.io
).
Constructively Validate and Iterate: As a meta-recommendation – once these changes are incorporated, it would be wise to review the architecture against a few use cases or even prototype components to ensure everything fits together. The goal is to have an architecture that is comprehensive (covering all critical concerns) yet not overly complicated. Trim any component that isn’t needed, but do not omit the core pieces like security or policy in the final version. Encourage feedback from team members or compare against reference architectures one more time. Given the bold additions above, you’ll end up with a much stronger blueprint for MCP:kaizen and MCP:celery, ready for implementation with confidence.
In summary, the Better Rewrite should reincorporate the robust multi-service structure and explicit flows of the Foundational draft, and both drafts must be extended with the new capabilities (security, memory, phase management, etc.) discussed. By also learning from external MCP implementations – emphasizing security gateways

 – the final architecture will be well-equipped to serve as the foundation for MCP:kaizen and MCP:celery. This comprehensive approach will ensure your MCP servers are secure, scalable, debuggable, and aligned with cutting-edge practices in the MCP ecosystem.
