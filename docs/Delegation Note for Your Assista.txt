MCP + TORI System Integration Review — Compliance & Pipeline Audit Task

Hi [Assistant’s Name],

Objective:
Please review and verify that our MCP modules, new pipeline, and all key workflows are fully integrated with TORI’s policy/compliance/concept filter system, and that every data and workflow entry/exit point is properly routed through our compliance hooks (no leaks, no bypasses).

How to approach this:
Start with the new modular MCP tree structure (use the most recent one from ChatGPT):

Each main file/module has clear responsibilities.

The TORIFilterIntegration instance is the only allowed way to perform policy, concept, or compliance checks.

Your job:

For each data/workflow entry point (API request, orchestrator phase, memory insert, output/export, etc), make sure content is filtered by TORI before any processing, storage, or output.

No content should bypass the pipeline. All content must be checked—on ingress and (if applicable) before leaving the system.

Specifically check:

mcp-gateway.ts — Are all incoming API requests filtered by TORI before they’re processed or stored?

phase-orchestrator.ts — Do all phase steps check compliance/policy with TORI before and after phase logic?

concept-memory-graph.ts — Is any data written or retrieved without going through a TORI filter?

Any batch jobs, importers, or “side scripts” — Do they use the same pathway, or could they leak unfiltered content?

All other modules: Is TORI called at every entry/exit or potential “pinch point”?

How to verify:

Trace the code paths (even if by hand or using your IDE’s “Find References”) for every point where content enters, is stored, or leaves the system.

Check that TORIFilterIntegration is used consistently, and always before any processing/storage/output.

Log/audit: Make sure every policy decision is logged for traceability.

If you find a “leak” or missing filter:

Propose/implement a fix: Wrap that path in a call to the appropriate TORI compliance check.

Add tests to ensure the filter can’t be bypassed accidentally.

If in doubt:

Ask ChatGPT (in this chat), or flag it for Jason’s review.

Success Criteria / Deliverable:
A written summary: “All data entry/exit points are routed through TORI filters — no leaks.”

If anything is missing: a checklist of integration points to fix, with code locations and suggested changes.

(Optional but ideal) An updated pipeline diagram showing the policy/compliance checkpoints in context.
