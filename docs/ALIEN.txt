I have  constructed a full, deployment-ready roadmap to complete the TORI Cognitive Blanket and Memory system within the next 8 hours. This will integrate your current implementation (40%), Écalle’s alien calculus synthesis, the unbuilt blueprint modules, and the formal math backend—all structured by build phase.

I'll return shortly with a clear, cohesive development plan detailing remaining modules, scaffolds, backend alignment (Rust/Python), proof layers (Lean/Coq), integration points, and priority sequencing.

Final Roadmap for TORI Cognitive Blanket and Memory

8-Hour Implementation Roadmap for TORI Cognitive Blanket and Memory System
This roadmap outlines a focused 8-hour development plan to implement the remaining modules of the TORI Cognitive Blanket and Memory system. We build on the current 40% implementation (ConceptMesh, ingest pipeline, caching, PDF extraction, runtime refresh hooks, WebSocket updates, alerting, admin dashboard) and integrate advanced theoretical constructs (Écalle’s alien calculus, transseries, ∞-groupoids, operads, sheaf cohomology) into practical features. The plan is divided into phases by hour, with specific tasks, file targets, and integration points. We ensure the existing ConceptMesh remains intact (augmented via hooks), that “alien/braid/scar” metadata is embedded at ingest (and updateable live), and that all new cognitive structures expose global APIs accessible to chat, analytics, and other TORI services.
Phase 1 (Hour 1): Multi-Scale Hierarchy & Core Hook Integration
Objective: Implement hierarchical breakdown of documents into sections/paragraphs with summaries (tiered retrieval), and prepare core structures for new cognitive metadata. This provides a “transseries-like” expansion of content (detailed paragraphs up to high-level summary) and sets the stage for deeper linkages.
Augment Ingest Pipeline for Hierarchy: Extend the ingest process to segment documents into a multi-scale structure. After PDF/text extraction, split content into chapters/sections and paragraphs. For each segment, generate a summary (using an NLP model or algorithm, e.g. via a Python helper or existing ML service). Store these summaries and hierarchical links in the ConceptMesh. File Targets: src/lib/server/MultiScaleHierarchy.ts (TypeScript orchestration) and update ConceptMesh data model (e.g., src/core/ConceptMesh.rs in Rust) to add fields for section and paragraph nodes, parent-child links, and summary text.
Implement Tiered Retrieval: Add functions to retrieve information at different scales. For example, a query can first fetch a section-level summary, then drill down to paragraphs on demand. Integrate caching for summaries (reusing the existing caching module) to speed up repeated retrieval【0†】. Interdependency: This ensures later modules (e.g. Wormhole Formation) can leverage summaries and section breakdown for linking concepts across contexts. It also aligns with transseries by treating each summary level as a term in an expansion of the document’s knowledge content.
Core Hooks for Cognitive Metadata: Introduce hook points in ConceptMesh for new metadata types. For instance, extend concept nodes with placeholders for “alien derivative” links, “scar” flags, and “braid” references. Implement an ingest hook (triggered after each document is ingested) that initializes these metadata:
Compute any initial alien metadata – e.g. tags or vectors that will later help link distant concepts (wormholes).
Mark potential scars – if the new content has contradictions or gaps relative to existing knowledge (this may just log a placeholder now to be filled in Phase 5).
Create an initial braid context – e.g. start a temporal trace if this document is part of a sequence.
These hooks ensure advanced cognitive data is embedded at ingest time (with ability to refine them during live use). File Targets: Update src/core/ConceptMesh.rs (Rust) or equivalent to include new fields (e.g. alien_derivatives: Vec<AlienTag>, scars: Option<ScarMetadata>, etc.), and add initialization logic in the ingest pipeline code (likely in src/lib/server/IngestController.ts).
Verification: After this phase, ingesting a sample document should result in a ConceptMesh entry with a multi-scale hierarchy (sections & paragraphs linked) and summary texts at each level. The system should allow retrieving a document’s summary or a specific section’s details via the new tiered retrieval API. These structures lay the groundwork for semantic linking in the next phase.
Phase 2 (Hour 2): Advanced Wormhole Formation (Semantic Linking)
Objective: Implement “wormholes” – semantic links between concept nodes that might be far apart in the ConceptMesh graph, strengthening with use. This realizes the idea of alien derivatives by connecting disparate knowledge branches in a resurgent way.
Semantic Link Discovery: Develop a routine to analyze new or updated content and find cross-document or cross-concept links. For each concept node added or updated, compute similarity or relatedness with other nodes (using embeddings or keyword overlap). If a strong latent connection is found between two distant nodes (e.g., a concept in a newly ingested paper relates to one in a different domain), create a wormhole link between them. This can be seen as computing an “alien derivative” – an operation that uncovers an offshoot connection beyond the local neighborhood
en.wikipedia.org
. Implementation: Use Rust for performance – e.g., add a WormholeEngine in src/core/wormhole.rs that iterates through candidate nodes and calculates semantic similarity (potentially using a precomputed embedding cache). Expose a binding in TypeScript (src/lib/server/WormholeFormation.ts) to invoke this after ingest or during queries.
Usage-Based Link Strengthening: Integrate wormholes with the runtime event system. When the chat or analysis modules frequently traverse a wormhole (i.e., a user jumps from one concept to a linked concept), increase the weight of that link. Implement this by capturing usage events from the WebSocket or analytics logs (leveraging the existing event hooks in the runtime). Each wormhole link in ConceptMesh should carry a weight or confidence score that increments on use. File Targets: Update ConceptMesh data structures to include link weights (e.g., ConceptMesh.add_wormhole(from, to, weight) in Rust). Possibly extend the caching or a new UsageTracker.ts to log accesses and call a Rust function to update weights.
Integrate with Ingest and Query: Modify the ingest pipeline hook (from Phase 1) to call the wormhole discovery after each document is ingested (embedding initial semantic links for new concepts). Also, during user queries or analysis tasks, allow the system to fetch not only direct neighbors from ConceptMesh, but also wormhole-linked concepts for broader context (tiered retrieval can pull these in as well). Ensure that if a wormhole is added or strengthened, a real-time update is sent via WebSocket (using the existing refresh hooks) so the UI/analytics dashboards can reflect the new connection.
Interdependencies: Wormhole formation benefits from Phase 1 (it can utilize section summaries or keywords to find links). It also sets the stage for Braid Memory (Phase 3) by providing alternate paths that a reasoning trace might take. This module remains modular – ConceptMesh is unchanged except new link entries – and all wormhole data is exposed via a global API (e.g., a function getRelatedConcepts(conceptId) in a global Cognitive API class).
Verification: After implementation, ingest another sample or use an existing ConceptMesh to trigger link creation. For example, if Concept A (from a science PDF) and Concept B (from an unrelated source) share a theme, a wormhole edge should appear in the data. Check via the admin dashboard or a debug API that these links exist and that repeated access (simulated via queries) increases their weight. The system now has a mechanism for dynamically connecting and reinforcing distant knowledge nodes, analogous to finding hidden connections via alien derivatives in cognitive terms.
Phase 3 (Hour 3): Braid Memory (Temporal Traces & Reasoning Paths)
Objective: Implement the Braid Memory module to record temporal sequences of reasoning (e.g. the chain of thoughts or references in answering a query) and link causal or related steps. These “braids” will be treated as paths in an ∞-groupoid (capturing different equivalence classes of reasoning routes).
Session Trace Capture: Instrument the chat and analysis workflow to capture each step a user or the system takes when reasoning. For example, when a question is asked, log the sequence: initial query -> concept retrieved -> related wormhole followed -> answer formulated. Each such sequence becomes a “braid” (a threaded path through the ConceptMesh). Implement a logging mechanism (possibly in src/lib/server/BraidMemory.ts) that receives events from the runtime (the existing WebSocket or analytics events can be tapped) and appends the involved concept IDs and operations into a temporal trace structure. Ensure each chat session or analytic session has a unique ID to group its braid.
Store and Link Braids: Extend ConceptMesh or a parallel structure to store these braid sequences. Each braid entry should record the ordered concepts and any outcomes (answers, decisions) for that session. In ConceptMesh, you might add a reference from involved concept nodes to braid IDs (so a concept “knows” which braids it participated in). This implements a form of sheaf of paths over the concept graph. Also, if two different braids arrive at the same conclusion via different paths, mark them as equivalent in an ∞-groupoid sense. Implementation: Use Python for heavy lifting of the category theory aspects – e.g., a Python module cog_theory/braid_groupoid.py can define a simple data model for an ∞-groupoid, where nodes are "states of knowledge" and morphisms are reasoning steps. Each braid can be added as a morphism composition. (For now, we can approximate this, storing braids and later identifying if two braids have the same start/end concepts, labeling them as equivalent class). The TypeScript side will call into this Python logic if advanced analysis is needed, or simply store the braid data for later processing.
Causal Link Annotation: Within each braid, annotate causal relationships: e.g., “Concept X led to Concept Y which led to Conclusion Z”. This can be done by adding metadata on the edges of the braid sequence (a simple cause-effect flag or timestamp). The result is a directed acyclic graph per session, which can be visualized as a braid diagram. File Targets: Continue development in src/lib/server/BraidMemory.ts for coordinating the recording, and update the ConceptMesh (Rust) to hold braid references (e.g., a map of concept -> set<braid_id> and a new data store for braid details, perhaps src/core/braid.rs). Also create cog_theory/Operad.hs or integrate into Python script to define how these braids compose with cognitive operations (see next bullet).
Operads for Cognitive Actions: Define the fundamental cognitive operations (retrieval, linking, summarization, inference) as composable actions. This can be conceptualized as an operad, where each operation is an element that can be composed into higher-level strategies. We won’t fully implement an operad library in 1 hour, but we establish a framework: e.g., define an enum or class of operations, and in each braid log include the operation performed between steps. This way, we can later compose these sequences (for example, two retrievals followed by an inference could be one composite operation). This theoretical underpinning will be useful in Phase 7 when orchestrating tasks. Document this design in-code (comments or a simple Operations.md file) and ensure the braid capture records the operation types.
Interdependencies: Braid Memory will consume data from wormholes (Phase 2) and multi-scale context (Phase 1) as it records reasoning paths that might traverse those links or summaries. In turn, having these braids stored enables the system to analyze reasoning patterns and possibly adjust concept links (e.g., if a certain path is very common, maybe strengthen those concept connections). It also sets up data for Background Orchestration to review or optimize later. The use of ∞-groupoids here is conceptual: multiple braids that effectively represent the “same” knowledge transformation (even if steps differ) can be considered equivalent – we may mark such cases in the data for future formal analysis (e.g., if two different question-answering paths yield the same answer, relate those braids).
Verification: Simulate a user session (or use an existing chat log) to ensure the braid recorder works. For instance, ask a question that causes the system to retrieve a document summary (Phase 1 feature) and follow a wormhole link (Phase 2 feature), then give an answer. Check that BraidMemory logged a sequence like [Query -> Doc Summary -> Wormhole Concept -> Answer] and stored it with a unique braid ID. Also verify that concept nodes involved have references to this braid. This demonstrates that temporal reasoning chains are being captured, enabling traceability of how answers are derived.
Phase 4 (Hour 4): Multimodal Integration (Image/Video/Audio Knowledge)
Objective: Extend the ingest and memory system to handle multimodal inputs (images, videos, audio) and integrate their content into the ConceptMesh alongside text. This broadens the knowledge base beyond text, allowing cross-modal cognitive links.
Ingest Pipeline Extensions for Media: Update the ingest pipeline to accept image, video, or audio files (in addition to PDFs/text). For each media type, implement an extraction step:
Images: Use an OCR or image captioning tool (e.g., a Python library like Tesseract for OCR or a pre-trained captioning model) to produce descriptive text or extract text from the image【0†】.
Video/Audio: Use speech-to-text (for audio tracks) or video OCR if necessary, producing a transcript or key frame captions.
The resulting text or descriptors are then ingested into ConceptMesh similarly to a document (sections = perhaps scenes or segments). File Targets: Create handlers, e.g., src/lib/server/MultimodalIntegration.ts, that call out to these extraction tools. Heavy lifting can be done in Python scripts (scripts/extract_image_text.py, scripts/transcribe_audio.py, etc.), invoked via child process or API call from the Node server.
Cross-Modal Linking: For each piece of media content ingested, link it with related textual concepts. For example, if an image caption yields “a cat on a skateboard”, find the ConceptMesh nodes for “cat” or “skateboard” and attach the image node there (a form of wormhole link but cross-modal). Introduce a new type of link or metadata for these relationships (e.g., ConceptMeshLink::Visual(reference) or a tag on the concept indicating an associated image). This ensures that queries about those concepts can surface the media content as well. Use the Advanced Wormhole Formation logic to help; for instance, treat the caption text as a mini-document and reuse Phase 2’s similarity matching to connect to existing concepts.
Multimodal Memory Storage: Extend the memory schema to store raw media references and their extracted metadata. Possibly add a lightweight media repository (could just be file paths or URLs stored in the concept node). For videos, store a link to the transcript segments as children of the media node (similar to how we store paragraph nodes for text). Verify that caching is employed (don’t re-run OCR on the same image repeatedly, for example – store the results).
UI/Visualization Placeholder: While full UI integration may be beyond the 1-hour scope, ensure that the system has API endpoints to retrieve media links. For example, an API like GET /concept/{id}/media could return any images or videos associated with that concept. This will allow the front-end (TypeScript UI) to display an icon or thumbnail for visual content. If time permits, update the admin dashboard to list media count or let the user preview an image associated with a concept.
Interdependencies: This module stands somewhat apart from previous phases, but it benefits from the same hook infrastructure. By integrating at the ingest level, we embed images and videos similarly to text – so the multi-scale summary (Phase 1) could even summarize a video transcript by scene, and wormhole logic (Phase 2) could link an image concept to a text concept. Ensure that adding this doesn’t break existing ingest flow: for example, wrap media handling in checks so that text ingestion remains unchanged.
Verification: Test by ingesting a sample image (with recognizable content) and a short video or audio clip. Confirm that:
Text is extracted (OCR or transcription) and stored in ConceptMesh (you should see a new “document” node for the media with child nodes if applicable, and some summary or keywords).
Links are created between the media-derived concepts and existing concepts (e.g., “cat” concept now has a link to the image node).
Retrieving that concept via the API also yields the media reference.
This ensures TORI’s memory is now multimodal, ready to incorporate diverse data.
Phase 5 (Hour 5): Concept Fuzzing & Graph Optimization
Objective: Implement tools to adaptively merge similar concepts, compressing and optimizing the ConceptMesh (avoiding duplication), and to “fuzz” concepts (generate variants to test and enrich the knowledge graph). This enhances the memory’s efficiency and resilience, addressing potential scars (inconsistencies or gaps) by smoothing the graph structure.
Duplicate Detection and Merging: Develop a routine to scan ConceptMesh for redundant or highly overlapping nodes (e.g., "NASA" vs "N.A.S.A." or same concept mentioned in two formats). Use a combination of string similarity and vector embedding distance to identify candidates. Implement a GraphOptimizer (in Rust for speed, file e.g. src/core/GraphOptimizer.rs) that can merge nodes: unify their links, sum up or average any metadata (like wormhole weights), and update references (so anywhere in the braid memory or other structures that pointed to the old nodes now point to the merged node). Expose this function to the Node layer via src/lib/server/ConceptFuzzing.ts or similar, which can be called periodically or on demand. Ensure to log these merges (for audit trail, possibly via the admin dashboard’s alerting system, since merging changes data).
Concept “Fuzzing” (Variant Generation): Create a small module to generate variant terms or queries around existing concepts to discover new connections. For example, take a concept name or its summary and produce synonyms, related terms, or slightly perturbed queries (this could leverage a thesaurus or word-embedding neighborhood). Then test these variants against the ConceptMesh – if any yields a hit or partial hit in search, consider linking or merging. This helps reveal scars or gaps: e.g., if a concept has no link to a synonym that appears elsewhere, that’s a gap to fix. Implement this in Python (for ease of using NLP libraries) – e.g., scripts/concept_fuzzer.py to generate synonyms/variants for a given concept. The TypeScript side (perhaps in ConceptFuzzing.ts) will orchestrate: for each key concept (maybe those with high centrality or those recently added), generate variant terms and see if new wormholes or merges should be made.
Adaptive Graph Compression: Use the above mechanisms to compress the graph structure adaptively. For instance, if many concepts link to a common parent concept, consider summarizing or abstracting that into a higher-level concept (creating a hierarchy). This overlaps with Multi-Scale Hierarchy: here we ensure that concept clusters are identified and potentially treated as one node for efficiency. The operad framework from Phase 3 can guide this: think of merging concepts as an algebraic “composition” that should preserve meaning. Although a full formal approach is complex, implement simple rules (like “if two nodes share >80% of connections, merge them”). Maintain a map of merged IDs to new ID to handle references.
Cohomology “Scar” Analysis: As a form of quality check, detect scars – places where the local consistency breaks globally. Implement a check that if a concept appears in multiple contexts that contradict (for example, an entity with two different birthdates across sources), flag it. Use a sheaf cohomology analogy: each concept’s properties from each source are like sections on overlaps; if they can’t all agree, the difference is a cohomology class (a “scar”). Implement a simple version: for each concept, look at key attributes or statements (if such data is stored) and see if any direct contradictions exist. Alternatively, use the braid data: if two reasoning paths yield conflicting answers for the same question, that’s a scar. Mark scars in the ConceptMesh (the scars field introduced earlier) with details of the conflict. This can be done in the background audit as well, but here we ensure the data model and detection routine exist. File Targets: Possibly extend src/core/ConceptMesh.rs to include a list of Scar entries per concept (each scar might contain references to the source of conflict). The detection logic can run in a background job (Phase 7), but the function to identify a scar can be prototyped here (in Python or Rust).
Interdependencies: This optimization phase takes advantage of all previous structures: it uses wormhole links and concept embeddings (Phase 2) to find merges, uses the ingest and multi-scale data (Phase 1) to compare content, and uses braid outcomes (Phase 3) to detect contradictions. The Concept Fuzzing part generates new potential links, which complements wormhole formation by not just reacting to what’s ingested, but proactively probing for hidden connections (like an alien calculus “exploration” of the function space of concepts). The results of this phase feed into the Background Orchestration – we’ll schedule these optimizations to run periodically.
Verification: Run the optimizer on the current ConceptMesh after previous phases. If there are known duplicates or obvious merges (maybe simulate by adding a duplicate concept manually), ensure the merge function consolidates them and that no references are broken (try querying the merged concept or checking a braid that involved the old concept). Test the fuzzer by picking a concept (e.g., “AI”) and generating variants (“Artificial Intelligence”, “machine learning” etc.) – check if the system finds any of those already in the graph and links them via wormhole or suggests a merge. If a conflict is known (for example, two documents have different data on a concept), see that a scar is flagged in that concept’s metadata. By the end of this phase, the knowledge graph should be cleaner, more connected, and annotated with any inconsistencies, ready for maintenance tasks.
Phase 6 (Hour 6): Integrate Advanced Theoretical Constructs
Objective: Consolidate and formalize the integration of Écalle’s alien calculus concepts, braid groupoids, and operads into the system’s logic. This phase ensures the theoretical framework is not just loosely referenced but has a concrete (if simplified) representation in the codebase, enhancing future extensibility and correctness.
Écalle’s Alien Calculus (Resurgence) Metadata: Finalize how alien derivatives and transseries are represented in TORI. For implementation, define a lightweight AlienMetadata struct/class to attach to concepts. For example, store a series expansion of a concept’s knowledge: perhaps represent each summary level (from Phase 1) as terms in a transseries (formal power series with exponentially small terms). This could simply be an ordered list of summary lengths or granularities, symbolizing an expansion. Document in code comments how this parallels transseries. Additionally, define an alien link marker for wormholes – e.g., tag wormhole edges with an “alien derivation ID” if they represent a jump that was discovered by our link algorithm (each such link is analogous to an alien derivative operator acting on the concept’s analytic continuation in knowledge space). While these are conceptual labels, including them means later we can perform operations like “apply alien derivative” which might trigger exploring a new link. File Targets: Update ConceptMesh data to include transseries_expansion (perhaps as a list of summaries or related concepts at increasing semantic “distance”) and label wormhole edges with an attribute (in the Rust data structure or a side table) indicating they were created by semantic inference (resurgence).
∞-Groupoids for Braid Structures: Ensure that the Braid Memory data (Phase 3) is structured in a way that can be treated categorically. Implement or integrate a simple library for groupoids if possible. For instance, use Python with networkx to model braids as graphs of reasoning where nodes are states and different paths connecting the same nodes are stored. In code, provide a function identify_equivalent_braids(braid_list) that finds braids with same start and end and tags them as equivalent (forming an ∞-groupoid homotopy class). This might simply add a field in the braid record like equivalence_class_id. If using Lean/Coq later, prepare a format to export these braid equivalences for formal verification. File Targets: cog_theory/braid_groupoid.py (Python) expanded with functions to compose and compare braids, and updates in BraidMemory.ts to call these functions when a new braid is recorded or when a session ends (to check if an equivalent braid already exists).
Operadic Composition of Cognitive Processes: Refine the operad concept introduced in Phase 3. Here, define a data structure for an Operad or simply a composition pipeline: e.g., a JSON schema or class that lists operations and how they compose. Implement a few examples: (Retrieve ∘ Summarize), (Retrieve ∘ Link ∘ Summarize), (Summarize ∘ Infer) etc., representing typical pipelines as operadic compositions. Store these patterns in a configuration (could be a simple map or array in BackgroundOrchestrator.ts or a YAML) such that the orchestrator can choose a pattern for a given task. This formalizes cognitive actions, making them easier to audit. If time permits, write a basic Lean/Coq specification of one operad composition to ensure it’s well-defined (optional at this stage).
Documentation and Team Guidance: As this theoretical integration can be complex, spend some time writing brief documentation (perhaps in a docs/ folder or as comments) explaining how alien calculus, sheaf cohomology, and operads map to our implementation. For example, note that “scars as sheaf cohomology” means we treat each inconsistency as a topological hole in the knowledge space, and our Scar markers identify those holes (we could formalize this as a 1-cocycle detection in the knowledge sheaf, to be explored in future versions). Similarly, describe how an alien derivative in code is essentially our wormhole discovery mechanism, etc. This will aid future developers or auditors (and tie in with Phase 7’s formal audit).
Interdependencies: This phase doesn’t produce a user-facing feature by itself, but it solidifies the foundations behind Phases 1–5. By embedding these concepts now, we ensure that the Background Orchestration and Audit phases can leverage them. For instance, knowing equivalent braids (groupoids) or having operad patterns will allow the background jobs or Lean proofs to verify that the cognitive processes are logically sound. Also, having the alien/transseries metadata means the system can expose these in analytics (e.g., an analytics service could show how “far” a wormhole jump was in terms of transseries order).
Verification: Since this is largely an internal alignment phase, verify by reviewing data structures and maybe a small test: e.g., create two simple braids manually that start and end at the same concept and run the equivalence checker – it should mark them as equivalent. Check that wormhole links now carry a label (like link.type = "alien" or similar) and that summary lists are stored as intended. These checks ensure the theoretical annotations are in place. Although the full benefit of these constructs is longer-term, the system is now instrumented with a rich cognitive meta-layer.
Phase 7 (Hour 7): Background Orchestration and Audit (Lean/Coq Integration)
Objective: Implement background jobs for system self-maintenance (periodic refresh, optimization, consistency checks) and integrate formal verification tools (Lean/Coq) to audit the cognitive structures in real-time and scheduled modes.
Scheduler for Maintenance Tasks: Set up a background job scheduler (e.g., use Node’s setInterval or a cron-like library in src/lib/server/BackgroundOrchestrator.ts). Define tasks to run at appropriate intervals:
Periodic Graph Optimization: Call the Concept Fuzzing & Graph Optimization routines (Phase 5) perhaps every hour or when the system is idle, to merge duplicates and clean up the graph continuously.
Wormhole Reinforcement Decay: Optionally, implement a decay for wormhole link weights (if a link hasn’t been used in a long time, slightly reduce its strength) to let the system refocus on active knowledge areas.
Braid Pruning: If braids are stored indefinitely, add a job to prune or archive old ones (or at least compress them) to keep memory light.
Refresh Summaries: If underlying content changes or on a schedule, regenerate summaries for heavily used documents to ensure they are up-to-date (this can use the Multi-Scale module).
Scars Review: Run the scar detection (from Phase 5) in a scheduled job to detect any new inconsistencies as the knowledge base grows, and possibly alert an admin if a serious conflict is found (leveraging the existing alerting system).
Document these tasks in the code for clarity. Ensure that the scheduler starts with the server and that tasks are spaced out to avoid heavy load spikes.
Real-Time Lean/Coq Hooks: For critical cognitive operations, integrate a lightweight formal check using Lean or Coq. For example:
When a new wormhole link is created, on a debug or development mode, spawn a Lean process to assert that adding this relation doesn’t create a logical contradiction in a simplified knowledge model. (This requires translating a small part of ConceptMesh into a Lean context – perhaps represent concepts as types or propositions and wormhole as an implication. This might be simplistic, but the idea is to catch obvious issues.)
When a braid concludes with an answer, optionally encode the reasoning as a sequence of implications and verify in Lean that the conclusion follows from the premises (this could be complex, but even a stub that always returns true can simulate this, to be filled in later).
Implement these hooks carefully so as not to block the main flow: e.g., run Lean/Coq in a separate thread or process, and if it times out or fails, log the result for later review. File Targets: Possibly create src/proof/lean_audit.lean (Lean file template) or proof/coq_audit.v and have the server fill in data and call lean --run or similar. The integration code can reside in BackgroundOrchestrator.ts for scheduled checks and in the relevant module (e.g., WormholeFormation) for real-time checks (wrapped in a non-blocking call).
Scheduled Deep Audit: In addition to on-the-fly checks, schedule a comprehensive audit (maybe nightly or weekly). This task will export the current state of key cognitive structures to a formal proof assistant for verification:
Export the ConceptMesh graph (or critical parts of it) as a set of logical statements (for instance, for each concept and link, create predicates in a Lean file expressing relationships).
Export operad compositions of cognitive actions as lemmas to check (e.g., verify that certain compositions are associative or achieve expected outcomes).
Export groupoid equivalences from braids as rewrite rules and see if they form expected homotopy (this is advanced; may be more of a future goal, but we can lay groundwork).
Once exported, run Lean/Coq on the file. If proofs fail or any inconsistency is found, log an alert (again using the alerting module to inform admins). This forms the cohomology check of the knowledge base – if something doesn't add up globally, the proof will fail, analogous to a non-zero cohomology class (a “hole” in knowledge).
Ensure this runs in a low-priority thread or off-peak time due to its intensity. Maintain a results log accessible via the admin dashboard (e.g., store the last audit status and time, perhaps shown as “last audit: success on 2025-06-04”).
Global API Exposure: As part of orchestration, finalize the global APIs for external modules:
Implement endpoints or service functions for each new feature (e.g., GET /memory/summary/{docId} for multi-scale summaries, GET /memory/wormhole/{conceptId} for related concepts, GET /memory/braid/{sessionId} for a reasoning trace, GET /memory/scars for listing current knowledge scars, etc.).
Secure these endpoints as needed (some might be admin-only, like scars or audit reports).
Document their usage so the chat service or analytics dashboards can call them. For example, the chat module can use the summary API to fetch a concise context for a follow-up question, or use the wormhole API to suggest related topics to the user. Analytics could use the braid API to visualize how an answer was derived, increasing transparency.
Interdependencies: This phase ties everything together. The scheduler will invoke routines from Phases 1–5 regularly to keep the system healthy. The Lean/Coq integration uses the structures defined in Phase 6 to formally reason about the system’s state. The global APIs ensure that all modules (chat, analytics, etc.) can access the cognitive blanket features implemented. By doing this last (in hour 7, just before final testing), we ensure all pieces are in place to be scheduled or verified. We also minimize overhead during development by adding formal checks after the core is working.
Verification: Manually trigger each background job to verify it behaves correctly:
Run the optimizer via the scheduler and confirm it merges or reports as expected (without affecting running services).
Simulate the Lean real-time hook with a benign scenario (perhaps feed a trivial knowledge base to Lean to see that our call works and returns success).
Run the full audit on a small subset of the graph (to keep it quick) and check that the system captures the result (for instance, intentionally introduce a contradiction in a test environment and see that Lean catches it).
Call each new API endpoint using a tool or the browser to ensure they return the expected data structure (for example, call the summary API and see the multi-scale summary, call the braid API and see a sequence of steps).
This confirms that maintenance and audit capabilities are functioning and that external services can integrate with the new cognitive features.
Phase 8 (Hour 8): Final Integration, Testing, and Deployment Readiness
Objective: Complete the integration of all modules, conduct end-to-end testing, fix any bugs or integration issues, and prepare the system for deployment with full Cognitive Blanket functionality.
Integrate Modules into Main Workflow: Ensure all new components are properly wired into the main TORI system:
The ingest pipeline now calls Multi-Scale Hierarchy (Phase 1) and Wormhole Formation (Phase 2) hooks sequentially for each new document. Verify the order: e.g., after extracting text, do multi-scale segmentation+summary, then wormhole linking using those summaries.
The runtime query/analysis flow utilizes Braid Memory (Phase 3): confirm that when the chat module retrieves info, it invokes the Braid logging. Update the chat service code to call a BraidMemory.startTrace(session) at start and log each step via a unified interface (possibly the global Cognitive API).
Multimodal content (Phase 4) ingestion should be enabled via the existing upload interfaces or admin tools. Test an end-to-end flow: uploading an image through the admin or API triggers the new pipeline branch.
Concept optimization (Phase 5) should tie in: for example, after bulk ingest or during idle times, ensure the scheduler (Phase 7) automatically runs it. There may not be a direct user-facing trigger, but an admin might have a “Optimize Now” button – if so, wire it to call the optimization function.
Ensure scar markers from Phase 5 are accessible – maybe expose them in the admin UI for review (e.g., highlight a concept in red if it has a scar, with tooltip of the issue).
All global API functions created in Phase 7 should be registered with the server’s routing (if using an Express-like framework, add the routes in src/lib/server/index.ts or equivalent).
Comprehensive Testing: Spend sufficient time testing each feature in concert:
Unit tests: If the project has a testing framework, write or update unit tests for each module (e.g., a test for MultiScale that feeds a sample text and expects a summary and subsections, a test for Wormhole that given two related mini-concepts it links them, etc.). Especially test edge cases like very large documents (multi-scale should handle gracefully by perhaps truncating summary) or no obvious wormhole (should not create false links).
Integration tests: Simulate real use cases: Ingest a mix of documents and media, then pose a complex query to the chat module. Observe if the system correctly uses the multi-scale summaries (maybe the answer uses a section summary), follows wormholes (bringing an unexpected but relevant fact), and logs the braid. Check the braid record after the fact. This end-to-end test will likely surface any miswired connections or performance issues.
Performance check: With the new modules, monitor memory/CPU. The Rust components (graph search, etc.) should keep things efficient, but confirm that, for example, the wormhole linking on ingest doesn’t slow down ingestion too much (if needed, mark it as async or deferred via the orchestrator).
Concurrency and Data Races: With new background tasks (Phase 7) and possibly multi-threaded Rust, watch for race conditions. Ensure that, for instance, the optimization job won’t run while an ingest is mid-way (could use simple locking or scheduling to avoid conflict). Test by ingesting data while the background tasks run.
Security audit: Quick check that exposing new APIs (like returning concept links or braid details) doesn’t leak sensitive info inadvertently. Since admin dashboard exists, perhaps restrict certain data to admin only. Also validate input on new endpoints (e.g., concept IDs are sanitized).
UI/UX Updates: If not already done, make small tweaks to UI to surface new capabilities:
In the chat interface, consider showing sources or the reasoning path (from Braid Memory) when providing an answer – this could be as simple as logging it for now, or a toggle to display it (the actual Homotopy.io-style visualization can be planned for a later iteration, but we ensure the data is available via API).
In the admin dashboard, add sections for “Cognitive Blanket Status” – showing counts like # of wormholes, # of braids recorded, # of scars identified, last audit result, etc. This gives a quick sanity check to the admin that the features are working post-deployment. This can be implemented in the dashboard frontend (TypeScript/React likely) by calling the global APIs from Phase 7.
Ensure WebSocket notifications are sent for major events if needed (e.g., if a new scar is found, maybe send a notification to admin; if new content ingested with summaries ready, maybe update a UI list).
Final Code Review and Cleanup: Do a pass through the codebase to clean up any leftover TODOs, ensure all new code has comments (especially where theoretical concepts are involved, to aid future maintenance). Remove or guard any debug logs. Double-check that configuration (like enabling Lean/Coq) is properly toggled (perhaps allow turning off heavy audits in production if needed, via config flag).
Deployment Readiness: Compile/build the project including the Rust components and run the full test suite. Prepare any migration or one-time scripts (for example, if the ConceptMesh schema changed – e.g., new fields for scars or transseries – ensure the existing data is migrated or backward-compatible). Update documentation for deployment: e.g., note the need to have Python environment with required libraries, and Lean/Coq installed on the server for the audit tasks to run. Finally, deploy to a staging environment and perform a smoke test with real data if available.
Verification: The system should now be fully functional with the “Cognitive Blanket.” Do one more high-level test: ingest a new document with text and an image, then ask the chat a question that requires that knowledge. The answer should come with supporting evidence from the multi-scale summary or wormhole-linked content, and the path taken should be recorded (and could be later visualized). Check the admin dashboard or logs to see that background jobs ran (maybe trigger the audit manually and see no errors). If all checks out, we have achieved full Cognitive Blanket readiness.
Final Checklist (Cognitive Blanket Readiness)
 Multi-Scale Hierarchy implemented – Documents are broken into sections/paragraphs with stored summaries, and retrieval at various scales works via API (MultiScaleHierarchy.ts).
 Wormhole Formation active – Semantic links between distant concepts are created on ingest and strengthened with use. Verify links exist in ConceptMesh and weights adjust on usage.
 Braid Memory capturing reasoning – All user sessions/analytic processes record their concept traversal paths. Braid data is stored and accessible, and equivalent reasoning paths are recognized (basic ∞-groupoid logic in place).
 Multimodal Integration complete – The system can ingest images/videos/audio, extract their content, and link them to textual concepts. Media content is queryable and associated with concepts in the graph.
 Concept Graph optimized – Redundant concept nodes are merged, synonyms linked; the graph is pruned of duplicates. “Scars” (inconsistencies) are identified and marked for review.
 Advanced metadata integrated – The ConceptMesh now carries alien calculus-inspired metadata (transseries expansions of content, alien derivative link tags) and operad-aware operation tags, enhancing the semantic richness of the model.
 Background jobs scheduled – Regular maintenance tasks (optimization, refresh, decay) and audits are running without impacting performance. Lean/Coq integration is configured (with real-time checks on critical operations and comprehensive scheduled audits passing on current data).
 Global APIs & UI updated – All new functionalities have accessible APIs or endpoints. The chat module and analytics tools can call these APIs (e.g., to fetch summaries, related concepts, reasoning traces). The admin UI reflects the status of the cognitive system (metrics, alerts).
 Testing and performance validation – The entire system passes integration tests, and performance is within acceptable limits (no major slowdown from new features). No critical bugs remain from new additions.
 Deployment ready – Configuration for new dependencies (Python libraries, Lean/Coq) is in place, documentation is updated, and the team is aware of how to monitor the new cognitive features post-deployment.
Once all the above are checked off, TORI’s Cognitive Blanket and Memory system can be considered fully implemented and ready for deployment, delivering a rich, multi-layered intelligence that integrates text, media, and advanced mathematical insights into a cohesive whole.
