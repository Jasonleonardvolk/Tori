  - Create regression test suites
  - Validate edge cases automatically

- __Safety certification__

  - Implement tools for standards compliance (e.g., ISO 26262)
  - Generate certification artifacts
  - Validate safety claims

## Phase 5: Multi-Agent Framework (3-4 months)

  - Develop domain adaptation techniques

- __HIL testing framework__

  - Create hardware-in-the-loop testing infrastructure
  - Implement automatic test execution
  - Develop reporting and analysis tools

## Implementation Strategy

1. __Critical Path Focus__: Fix circular references first as this unblocks all subsequent work
2. __Continuous Integration__: Feature branches with comprehensive testing
3. __Incremental Adoption__: Gradual feature introduction with backwards compatibility
4. __Modular Architecture__: Clean separation of language, generation, and tools
5. __User-Centered Design__: Regular testing with robotics engineers

By prioritizing the circular reference fix for the manipulator controller now, we create a solid foundation for the entire development roadmap. Each phase builds on the previous one with clear dependencies and milestones.

Does this comprehensive plan effectively integrate our immediate priorities with the long-term vision?
