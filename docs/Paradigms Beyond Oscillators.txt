4. Paradigms Beyond Oscillators: Emerging and Speculative Substrates
If not oscillators, then what? Here we venture into post-oscillatory paradigms – alternative physical/computational substrates that could complement or supersede oscillator-based designs for advanced computation and cognition. These ideas range from cutting-edge research to highly speculative concepts. They represent ways to transcend the limitations we discussed by using different physics or computation models altogether. Topological Computing and Braided Quasiparticles: One of the most exciting paradigms is topological quantum computing, which uses exotic quasiparticles (anyons) in two-dimensional materials to store and manipulate information in a topologically protected way. The principle is that information is encoded in global topological properties (e.g. the winding of particle trajectories) rather than local states. For example, in a topological quantum computer, the world-lines of non-Abelian anyons (their paths through spacetime) form braids, and the pattern of these braids implements logic gates
en.wikipedia.org
. The outcome of a computation depends only on the topology of the braid (how many times they wind around each other), not on the specific timing or details of motion
en.wikipedia.org
. This makes the computation inherently robust to noise: small perturbations cannot change the braid’s topology, so the quantum information is protected
en.wikipedia.org
. In essence, topological substrates address a major limitation of oscillator/phased-based systems – sensitivity to perturbations – by encoding information in qualitative, not quantitative features. A famous analogy is that it’s like tying a knot: as long as the knot stays intact, its information is preserved even if the rope is jostled. 

Topological quantum computing concept: world-lines of quasiparticles (anyons) braid in time (vertical axis) and two spatial dimensions to form logic operations. In this diagram, colored strands represent anyon trajectories weaving around each other; the specific braid corresponds to a unitary operation mapping an initial state $|\Psi_i\rangle$ to a final state $|\Psi_f\rangle$. Crucially, the computation’s result depends only on the topology of this braid (which anyons loop around which), not on the exact path shapes
en.wikipedia.org
. This topological encoding makes the process resistant to local noise – a slight deformation in a strand doesn’t change the braid pattern. Such topologically protected operations could overcome decoherence and error issues that limit conventional and oscillator-based quantum computers
en.wikipedia.org
. Topological computing isn’t only quantum – one could imagine classical topological computing where information is encoded in invariants like knot configurations or topological phases of matter. There is early work on using topologically protected states in photonic or mechanical systems for information processing. The big idea is to go beyond the paradigm of “state variables that must be precisely maintained” (like an oscillator’s phase) to “state features that are globally robust.” By doing so, we might build computers that scale without fragility – adding more components doesn’t introduce exponential noise sensitivity because the information is non-local. In the realm of AI and cognition, topological approaches might help with memory and reasoning: for instance, one could envision a system where concepts are stored as braided entanglements that cannot be easily disrupted, addressing the storage stability issues of oscillators. While this is speculative, braiding of world-lines might even serve as an alternate form of “clock” or sequence control, essentially weaving computations in a spacetime fabric rather than stepping through an algorithm sequentially. This harks to the idea of computation in the fabric of spacetime itself. Non-Hermitian and PT-Symmetric Systems: Traditional physical systems for computing are conservative or dissipative but treated as closed (Hermitian in quantum mechanics). Non-Hermitian physics, especially parity-time (PT) symmetric systems, have gained attention for their exotic properties. PT-symmetric systems have balanced gain and loss such that their spectrum can remain real (oscillation-like) up to a threshold. They exhibit exceptional points – critical points where eigenstates coalesce – which can lead to huge sensitivity boosts or novel state-switching behaviors. How can this be useful for computing? One example: researchers have proposed PT-symmetric optical neural networks, where instead of encoding weights in phase shifts (which is what optical oscillators usually do), they encode in gain/loss contrasts
arxiv.org
. By tuning the amplification or attenuation in waveguides (a non-Hermitian approach), they achieved a functional neural network that learns to recognize patterns with comparable accuracy to normal optical networks
arxiv.org
. This approach can circumvent some limitations of pure oscillatory (phase-based) networks – phase shifters can be bulky or slow, whereas modulating gain (optical amplification or absorption) can be faster and more compact
arxiv.org
. More generally, non-Hermitian systems allow asymmetric signal propagation (lossy in one direction, amplifying in another) and mode selectivity that Hermitian systems lack. This could enable new types of logic: for instance, an amplifier can act as a one-way gate or a means to implement nonlinear activation in analog computing. PT-symmetric electronics or photonics could create circuits that spontaneously perform logic by switching at exceptional points. A PT dimer (two coupled resonators, one with gain, one with loss) can act as a self-adjusting threshold element – beyond a certain gain, the mode “blows up” in one resonator and dies in the other, which could be interpreted as a binary decision. Unlike standard oscillators which either oscillate or don’t, PT circuits have the interesting property of phase transition between oscillatory and exponential regimes. Information could be encoded not just in the phase but in which mode is dominant. Non-Hermitian systems thus add a new knob – gain/loss – which broadens computational possibilities. They could implement logic gating, signal rectification, and enhanced sensing within analog computing architectures. For example, sensors at exceptional points can detect frequency shifts with ultra-high sensitivity (since splitting of eigenfrequencies scales as the square root of the perturbation, not linearly), which might feed into information processing for tiny signal detection tasks. More fancifully, one could imagine non-linear PT-symmetric neural circuits where neurons are not just integrators but have built-in gain dynamics that give them an adjustable resonance or damping, effectively learning by shifting their individual PT phase. This might provide a new mechanism for memory or adaptation: memories could be stored in the gain profiles (loss or pump power) rather than synaptic weight, creating a form of analog non-volatile memory that oscillators alone didn’t have. Holographic Models and Information Geometry: The term “holographic” here is multi-faceted. In a computing context, it refers to representations or computing schemes inspired by holography, where information is distributed and encoded in interference patterns. One example in AI is holographic reduced representations (HRR) or hyperdimensional computing, where items are represented as high-dimensional vectors and combined via operations analogous to convolution (which is like an interference pattern) – the result is that multiple pieces of information can overlap in one high-D vector without destroying each other, akin to how a hologram stores an image across the entire medium. Such models (pioneered by Tony Plate and others) have been proposed as brain-like because they allow superposed, distributed representation of structured data (e.g. encoding a semantic relation by convolving vector representations of concepts). Hyperdimensional computing has shown promise in robotics and cognition tasks, offering fast one-shot learning and robustness to noise by virtue of high redundancy. This is post-oscillatory in the sense that, while an implementation might still use oscillators or electronics, the conceptual substrate is the high-dimensional vector space (often a random one) and computing is done by simple operations (XOR, cyclic shift, etc.) that correspond to geometric transforms on these vectors. “Holographic” also evokes the holographic principle in physics (like the AdS/CFT correspondence), where a higher-dimensional system can be described by a lower-dimensional one. Some researchers have speculated about holographic brain theories

 or using the mathematics of AdS/CFT duality to model mental processes
pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
. While highly theoretical, the notion of computation in a dual space could allow hard problems to map to easier ones. Imagine if a cognitive problem could be mapped (via some unknown correspondence) to a simpler problem in a dual representation (like transforming a symbolic problem into a geometric one where it becomes trivial). This is analogous to solving a problem by Fourier transform: convolution in time is multiplication in frequency. Similarly, a holomorphic or geometric representation of a problem might turn combinatorial explosions into manageable growth. In practical terms, information geometry – viewing information processing in terms of geometry (manifolds, geodesics, curvature of solution space) – is becoming a powerful paradigm. For instance, in machine learning, natural gradient descent uses the Fisher information metric to follow steepest descent in a curved parameter space. One could imagine computing by geodesic flow on an information manifold: the computer is set up such that physical dynamics correspond to following curvature toward an objective minimum. This moves beyond oscillations to something like continuous deformation computing. Some optimization solvers already use physical analogy (e.g. mass-spring systems settling to minimal energy). Information geometry might formalize that: computing could be done by steering a system along geodesics that solve an information-theoretic optimality condition. Bridging holography with hardware, one concrete development is optical holographic computing – using actual optical interference to compute transforms. Optical convolutional neural networks, for instance, use diffractive elements to perform convolutions (leveraging that a lens does a Fourier transform). If we extend this, an optical hologram could potentially carry out matrix multiplication or even higher-order tensor operations in a single pass, by virtue of interference patterns. These are still linear operations mostly, but with nonlinear materials, one could incorporate some nonlinearity. The advantage is ultra-fast (speed of light) and parallel computation. Such systems treat the phase of light and path differences similarly to how oscillator networks treat phase – but instead of a closed loop oscillation, they are open propagation, which may scale better (no need for sustained Q-factors; the computation is one-and-done as the light propagates). In summary, holographic paradigms aim to use high-dimensional, distributed representations and possibly physics dualities to overcome the limited “one oscillator per piece of info” model. They promise robust superposition (many items in one representation) and potentially new ways to perform computation by physical analogy rather than explicit algorithms. Quantum Field and Spacetime-Based Computation: Going even more fundamental, one can ask if computation can be embedded in the very fabric of spacetime or fields, not just particles or circuits. Quantum field computing might involve exploiting field configurations (like solitons, instantons, topological defects) as carriers of information processing. For example, a recently explored concept is using time-dependent fields and space-time curvature to compute. If one had a controllable spacetime metric (purely hypothetical at this point), one might solve problems by warping time – akin to how gravitational time dilation could speed up computations in one region relative to another. A less exotic example is using analog field simulators: for instance, an optical fiber network can simulate certain Hamiltonian dynamics (by mapping time in the fiber to space in the simulated system). These simulators can solve differential equations or optimize functionals by letting a field evolve naturally. Spacetime analogies have even led to ideas of hypercomputation: certain solutions of general relativity (so-called Malament–Hogarth spacetimes) allow an infinite computation to be completed from an outside observer’s perspective in finite proper time by an observer falling into a black hole. In theory, a computer utilizing a closed timelike curve or such a spacetime could solve non-Turing-computable problems or NP-hard problems efficiently
arxiv.org
. For example, a computer that can send results back in time to avoid brute-force search can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial (even deterministic) time
arxiv.org
. These ideas remain in the gedankenexperiment realm (we don’t have causal loops at our disposal), but they are intriguing: computation outside the normal forward flow of time could break current complexity limitations. Researchers have shown that if one had a Deutschian closed timelike curve, one could find fixed-points that solve PSPACE problems by essentially forcing consistency on a looped computation
arxiv.org
. Even without actual time travel, some algorithms try to mimic this via postselection or other tricks. The key takeaway: causality is a resource. Normal computers respect forward-time causality strictly; a “post-oscillator” paradigm might exploit retrocausal effects (as some interpretations of quantum mechanics allow) to perform otherwise impossible feats. Another angle is analog relativistic cellular automata – imagine a grid of cells where updates happen according to local rules and signals are limited to light-speed. This could simulate physics at a fundamental level (some have conjectured the universe itself is a kind of cellular automaton at the Planck scale). If true, then perhaps tapping into those fundamental processes (quantum gravity or Planck-scale phenomena) could yield new computing capabilities. Some have suggested that quantum gravity could be viewed as computation (the “It from Bit” concept of Wheeler), implying that space-time itself computes. While fascinating, we are far from harnessing that. However, a more practical spin-off is using quantum field devices like Bose–Einstein condensates or superconducting circuits that behave as analog field equations solvers. These can tackle certain problems (like solving nonlinear differential equations) faster than digital discretization. Cellular Automata at Fundamental Scales: Classical cellular automata (CA) are a discrete model of computation, but interestingly, they can be considered a substrate beyond oscillators in that they are inherently spatial and distributed with local interactions. Some researchers in digital physics hypothesize that the universe at the smallest scale might be a kind of CA, updating in Planck time increments. If so, computation could be done by embedding problems in physical processes directly – essentially leveraging the natural CA of reality. Even if not, cellular automata as a paradigm (like Conway’s Game of Life, or Wolfram’s elementary CAs) demonstrate how complex behavior and universal computation can arise from simple local rules. CA-based computing architectures (like nanowire networks, or FPAA on chip CAs) could be a “beyond oscillator” approach in that they don’t rely on oscillatory dynamics but on propagation of discrete signals in a grid. Some experimental processors, like collision-based computers or reservoir computers built from unconventional materials (e.g. excitable chemical media), effectively implement cellular automata – the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, for instance, supports autowaves that behave like CA signals. At relativistic or Planck scales, one faces the union of quantum uncertainty and discrete structure – here we enter the domain of quantum cellular automata (QCA). QCAs are essentially the quantum version of updating an array of qubits in local neighborhoods, which could be a framework for quantum computation that’s inherently scalable (no global oscillations or gates needed, just many local updates). Studying QCAs might give insights into quantum computation in a way more analogous to field evolution rather than circuit oscillations. Ultimately, if one could engineer at the level of individual particles or spacetime quanta, one might implement computation that works with the grain of the universe’s discretization, potentially achieving maximal efficiency. This is speculative and far-future – currently, even controlling a thousand qubits is non-trivial, let alone $10^{23}$ Planck-scale cells. But conceptually, computation at the limit of physical law (be it the Bremermann’s limit, Lloyd’s ultimate laptop bound, or beyond) will require leveraging all aspects of physics, not just electrical oscillations. Biological Morphogenesis and Swarm Intelligence: Not all computation of interest is electronic or quantum – nature computes in many ways. Beyond oscillatory neural processes, living systems exhibit other paradigms like chemical computing and collective intelligence that might inspire new architectures.
Morphogenesis: The development of an embryo (as first described by Turing’s reaction-diffusion theory) is essentially a computational process – chemical gradients and cell interactions “compute” the body plan. Reaction-diffusion systems can spontaneously form complex patterns from uniform initial conditions via instabilities and feedback. These chemical pattern-formers can be turned into actual computing devices. Pioneering work has shown that a reaction-diffusion chemical medium (like the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction) can solve mazes or optimize paths by the way chemical wavefronts propagate. In one experiment, a chemical computer found the shortest path in a labyrinth by the path that the reaction wave first reached the end – an analog to breadth-first search. This is computation by spreading and extinction of chemical “signals,” quite unlike oscillators. Another example: chemical droplets that attract or repel can compute clustering and path-finding. Morphogenetic computation tends to be slow but highly parallel and robust to damage (a pattern will self-repair or adjust if part of the medium is removed). The tradeoff is that it’s hard to get precise outputs – you often “read” a result from a visual pattern, which might be fine for some applications (like constructing structures or solving routing problems).
Cytoskeletal and Molecular Computing: As touched on earlier, within cells, structures like microtubules and actin filaments process information in ways we are just beginning to understand. Microtubules have resonances and can support solitonic signals or ionic waves along their length. They also form complex networks that can perform amplification and logical operations (according to some theories). There is speculation and some evidence that microtubule networks may implement a form of molecular computing, potentially even quantum-coherent at some scales
frontiersin.org
frontiersin.org
. For instance, microtubules have electronic excitation states that could couple, giving a cell-internal information processor quite separate from the neuron’s membrane potential logic. If one could harness such cytoskeletal processing, it might be far more dense and fast than neural spiking – microtubule oscillations in the GHz or even THz range have been reported, which dwarfs the kHz firing rates of neurons
frontiersin.org
. It’s controversial, but some propose that consciousness arises from orchestrated computations in microtubule quantum states (the Penrose-Hameroff Orch-OR theory)
frontiersin.org
frontiersin.org
. Whether or not that’s true, it points to a paradigm where the computing elements are at a smaller scale and different nature than neurons or circuits – perhaps harnessing molecular vibrations, excitons, or other quantum properties in a warm, wet environment. To build an artificial analog, one might look at polymer computing or nano-photonic networks in polymer fibers that mimic microtubule networks.
Swarm Intelligence: Social insects (ants, bees, termites) collectively perform computations that individual insects are incapable of. Ant colonies find shortest paths to food sources via pheromone trail laying – effectively solving graph optimization by a distributed, iterative process where each ant is a simple agent but the colony as a whole finds near-optimal routes
cap.stanford.edu
. This has led to the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm in computer science, a successful heuristic for problems like the traveling salesman problem. Similarly, bees collectively decide on a new nest site through waggle dances – an elegant decentralized voting system with feedback loops. These biological systems compute without any oscillatory synchronization (though interestingly, some do exhibit oscillations: e.g. fireflies sync their flashing, but that’s more a communication mechanism). The key computational principle is self-organization through local interactions and feedback. In an artificial context, one could envision collective computing substrates: imagine a very large network of simple agents (nano-robots or molecules) that perform computation by diffusion of signals (like pheromones) and simple rules. This is neither digital nor analog in the usual sense, but emergent computing. It could be robust (no single point of failure, graceful degradation) and adaptive (automatically reconfiguring to solve problems akin to how slime mold adapts its body to explore mazes). Already, Physarum polycephalum (slime mold) has been shown to solve complex problems like finding shortest paths and even a version of the traveling salesman problem by literally growing networks that connect points in efficient ways
sci.news
. One study demonstrated that with a bit of feedback guidance (light to simulate repellent), the slime mold can solve small TSP instances in linear time
sci.news
, effectively leveraging parallel physical growth to circumvent exponential search. This is a hint that by stepping outside the conventional architectures, we might harness nature’s parallelism. A slime mold or an ant colony isn’t fast in clock speed, but it uses massive parallelism and adaptivity – it computes by evolving a solution. In a futuristic sense, maybe growing computations (like evolving chemical or bio-electric patterns) could solve problems that stump static circuits or require too many serial steps.
In essence, these biological paradigms (chemical, cytoskeletal, swarm) are beyond oscillators in that they rely on growth, diffusion, excitation waves, or collective emergent order – not on well-defined periodic cycles. They can solve certain classes of problems (geometric, topological, optimization, pattern recognition) extremely well, sometimes outperforming digital algorithms in scalability or robustness. However, they come with trade-offs like difficulty in programming and reading precise outputs. Nonetheless, they inspire novel computing hardware: for example, there are prototypes of slime-mold-inspired computers that use live slime molds to route data or perform computation
mediamatic.net
, and chemical computers that use reactions to solve algebraic problems. As we push toward artificial general intelligence or novel computing devices, we may incorporate these principles – perhaps hybrid systems where a swarm of micro-robots provides a self-organizing memory, a chemical reaction-diffusion module handles path planning, a topological quantum co-processor handles secure storage, etc. Such a heterogeneous architecture might overcome the limits of any single paradigm (be it oscillatory or digital) by task-specialization, much like the brain uses electrical spikes, chemical neuromodulators, and gene expression changes all for different time-scale aspects of cognition.
