1. Could you confirm that the fallback 'typescript_fallback' method in the UI is only used when no successful Python result is returned (i.e., FastAPI extraction fails or times out)?
2. Are there any cases where both the FastAPI server and the fallback might run in parallel or trigger race conditions?
3. Can you confirm whether the UI now receives and correctly parses the new JSON structure returned by the updated /extract endpoint?

Excellent questions! Let me analyze your pipeline code thoroughly to confirm these critical points.
1. TypeScript Fallback Trigger Conditions
Looking at your +server.ts, the TypeScript fallback is triggered only when:
typescript// Line 95-96 in +server.ts
if (!apiUsed || conceptNames.length === 0) {
    console.log('ðŸ”„ [UPLOAD] STEP 2: Using TypeScript fallback extraction...');
This happens when:

apiUsed = false (FastAPI call failed or timed out)
OR conceptNames.length === 0 (FastAPI returned success but with no concepts)

The apiUsed flag is only set to true when:
typescriptif (res.ok) {
    pythonResult = await res.json();
    conceptNames = pythonResult.concept_names || [];
    method = pythonResult.extraction_method || 'universal_pipeline';
    apiUsed = true;  // Only set here
}
Confirmed: TypeScript fallback only runs when FastAPI fails, times out, or returns empty results.
2. Race Conditions and Parallel Execution
Looking at the flow, there are NO race conditions because:
typescripttry {
    // Step 1: Try FastAPI (with 60-second timeout)
    const res = await fetch('http://localhost:8002/extract', {
        signal: AbortSignal.timeout(60000)
    });
    
    // Process response...
} catch (err) {
    // Only after failure/timeout
}

// Step 2: Only runs AFTER Step 1 completes/fails
if (!apiUsed || conceptNames.length === 0) {
    // TypeScript fallback
}
The execution is strictly sequential:

FastAPI attempt (waits up to 60 seconds)
Only if that fails â†’ TypeScript fallback
No parallel execution occurs

Confirmed: No race conditions. The pipeline is sequential with clear fallback logic.
3. JSON Structure Compatibility
Let's verify the JSON structures match:
FastAPI Returns (main.py):
pythonreturn {
    "success": True/False,
    "concept_names": [...],
    "concept_count": 12,
    "extraction_method": "universal_pipeline",
    "status": "success",
    # ... other fields from pipeline.py
}
UI Expects (+server.ts):
typescriptpythonResult = await res.json();
conceptNames = pythonResult.concept_names || [];  // âœ… Matches
method = pythonResult.extraction_method || 'universal_pipeline';  // âœ… Matches
UI Builds Final Response:
typescriptreturn json({
    success: true,
    concepts: concepts,  // Full concept objects
    conceptCount: concepts.length,
    extractionMethod: method,
    pythonResult: pythonResult,  // Raw Python result included
    // ...
});
Key compatibility points:

âœ… concept_names array is correctly parsed
âœ… extraction_method is correctly used
âœ… The UI transforms concept_names into full concept objects with scores
âœ… Raw pythonResult is preserved for debugging

Additional Observations
Error Handling Enhancement Needed
Your current main.py error handling returns a dict on error, which is good:
pythonexcept Exception as e:
    return {
        "success": False,
        "error": str(e),
        "concept_count": 0,
        "concept_names": [],
        "status": "error",
        "extraction_method": "error"
    }
This ensures the UI always gets a parseable response even on errors.
Timeout Handling
The 60-second timeout is appropriate for large PDFs:
typescriptsignal: AbortSignal.timeout(60000) // 60 seconds
Concept Score Generation
The UI correctly generates descending scores for concepts:
typescriptconst concepts = conceptNames.map((name, index) => ({
    name,
    score: Math.max(0.4, 0.95 - index * 0.03), // 0.95 â†’ 0.4
    // ...
}));
Summary

TypeScript fallback: âœ… Only triggers when FastAPI fails or returns empty results
Race conditions: âœ… None - execution is strictly sequential
JSON compatibility: âœ… Structures match correctly

Your pipeline is well-designed with proper fallback logic. The only issue is the uvicorn file watcher crash, which my previous solution addresses. Once you fix that startup issue, your pipeline should work flawlessly!
