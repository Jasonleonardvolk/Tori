## Script Details

### Introduction
"Welcome to this quick tour of the Tori beta! We'll see how it helps you code faster with AI assistance and natural interactions."

### App Launch
"The app launches quickly and uses around 120 MB of RAM - notice the memory footprint displayed in the top right corner."

### Code Assistance Demo
"Let's try a common task - refactoring a complex loop. I'll paste this nested loop and ask Tori to refactor it."

### Avatar & Voice
"Notice how the avatar's lip movements sync with the spoken response. The emotional tone matches the content naturally."

### Export Feature
"When you want to save a solution or share with teammates, just click the export button. You can choose different quality presets."

### UI Features
"Hovering over these ψ-nodes shows additional context about the algorithm's thought process."

### Diagnostics
"If you encounter any issues, the diagnostic recorder captures the last 5 seconds of activity. Let me simulate a crash to show you..."

### Closing
"That's a quick overview of Tori beta! Please share your feedback in our Discord channel, and thanks for being part of our beta program."
