# ALAN: Foundations of a Post-Symbolic Cognitive IDE

* *Phase 1 Milestone Report: Cognitive Architecture, Field Dynamics, and Semantic Geometry**

- --

## 1. Project Vision & Motivation

ALAN is not just an IDE—it is a cognitive substrate for code, where concepts live as dynamic fields, not static tokens. Our motivation is to transcend the symbolic paradigm, building a semantic operating system where code is navigated, refactored, and debugged by resonance, geometry, and field dynamics. This vision is rooted in the conviction that cognition—both human and artificial—emerges from distributed, phase-based, attractor-driven processes.

## 2. Core Architecture

* *[Architecture Block Diagram Placeholder]**

- **ALAN Core:** Phase-coupled Kuramoto oscillator network representing concepts as dynamic attractors.
- **Koopman Engine:** Real-time EDMD decomposition, spectrum extraction, and morphing along dominant eigenmodes.
- **κ-Geometry Module:** Embeds concepts in curved manifold space (Euclidean, Spherical, Hyperbolic), enabling curvature-aware coupling and geodesic decay.
- **UI/Visualization Layer:** Live field visualization, morph console, entropy/attractor tracking.

## 3. Geometry & Field Dynamics

Concepts are not mere nodes—they are points in a manifold, with relationships shaped by κ-geometry. Coupling strength decays along geodesics, and field evolution is governed by phase synchrony and resonance. The system supports:

- Dynamic concept ingestion into the semantic graph
- Phase oscillator stabilization and noise resilience
- Koopman operator-driven extrapolation and morphing
- Spectral clustering and functional concept alignment

## 4. Live Visualization & Control

* *[Concept Field Canvas & Visual Output Placeholders]**

- The Concept Field Canvas displays the live resonance structure, phase dynamics, and semantic proximity of the codebase.
- Visual overlays include phase hue, coupling strength, resonance amplitude, and Koopman mode vectors.
- The Morph Console allows semantic morphing of regions along Koopman modes, with immediate visual feedback and field re-synchronization.
- Entropy and attractor panels track the dynamical state and transitions of the concept field.
