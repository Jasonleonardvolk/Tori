Designing an Engaging Login & Onboarding Experience for TORI
Authentication Options & Conditional Login UI
A smooth login experience sets the stage for user engagement. TORI should support both email/password and OAuth (Google, Facebook, Apple) sign-ins to cater to user preferences. Offering social login shortcuts can reduce friction – studies note that adding options like Google or Facebook login makes onboarding easier and boosts activation rates
userguiding.com
. Implement a conditional rendering approach so that login forms/buttons appear only when the user is logged out. In practice, this means checking the session state and showing a login component (or redirecting to a login page) for unauthenticated visitors, while hiding or skipping it entirely for logged-in users. This avoids redundant prompts and lets returning users dive straight into TORI’s content. From a technical standpoint, frameworks like SvelteKit make conditional UI straightforward (e.g. using {#if user} blocks or route guards). Many authentication libraries also provide utilities for this (for example, Clerk offers <SignedIn> / <SignedOut> wrappers, and Firebase Auth or Supabase Auth can be checked via a global user object). The key is to ensure the UI automatically adapts to auth state:
Logged-Out State: Display a welcome screen or modal with email/password fields and “Continue with Google/Apple/Facebook” buttons. Keep the layout simple and focused – avoid any other content that could distract from signing in. Ensure the OAuth options are clearly branded and placed prominently (e.g. above or below the email form) to encourage easy one-click login

. A brief tagline can reassure users about data privacy (“We’ll never post without permission,” etc.).
Logged-In State: Immediately show the main interface (greeting and content) instead of any login prompts. If using a Single Page App, your code should bypass the login component when a valid session token exists (for example, using a session cookie in SvelteKit’s load function or a context provider in React). This conditional rendering guarantees returning users are not annoyed by unnecessary sign-in steps

.
Maintaining style and privacy: It’s important that whichever auth solution you integrate fits TORI’s design aesthetic and keeps user data safe. Tools like Clerk provide ready-made UI components and support multiple OAuth providers out of the box, which can accelerate development. Clerk’s components can be themed to match your app’s style, and they even offer a “headless” mode to use your own markup for full control
sveltekit.io
. The trade-off is that hosted solutions (Clerk, Auth0, Firebase, etc.) handle user credentials on their servers – you get convenience and scalability, but you entrust user data to a third party
sveltekit.io
. If privacy is paramount and you want to self-host data, consider frameworks like Supabase Auth or open-source libraries (e.g. Lucia for SvelteKit) which let you store user credentials in your database. These require a bit more setup but keep data in-house
sveltekit.io
sveltekit.io
. For example, Supabase offers easy email/OAuth login and can be self-hosted for full control, whereas Firebase Auth is easy to set up but less flexible to customize in terms of UI or data model
sveltekit.io
. In summary, choose an auth integration that balances developer effort, branding control, and user privacy for TORI:
SvelteKit + Lucia or custom Node/Express: maximal control over UI and data (you design the login form, store creds in your DB), but higher development effort.
SvelteKit + Supabase: pre-built auth functions (email link, OAuth) with the ability to style your own forms; data can be self-hosted for privacy.
SvelteKit + Clerk or Firebase: quickest to implement (Clerk even has prebuilt screens), but user data flows through third-party servers. Clerk is highly polished and offers a generous free tier
sveltekit.io
, suitable if you’re comfortable with their cloud; Firebase is free for basic use and widely trusted, though its UI must be built or skinned manually.
Custom Node Identity Service: ultimate flexibility – you build the entire auth, perhaps using libraries like Passport.js or Auth.js – but not recommended unless you have very specific needs, given the maintenance burden
sveltekit.io
.
No matter the choice, preserve a consistent style. For TORI, that likely means a clean, calming interface – even the login screen should reflect TORI’s personality (friendly copy, maybe a subtle logo or mascot). Use concise text on buttons (“Sign in with Google”, not long sentences) and ensure accessibility (clear labels, error messages for invalid logins, etc.). By handling authentication seamlessly and only showing login when needed, you keep the focus on TORI’s assistance rather than on gatekeeping screens.
Personalized Greetings for New vs Returning Users
Once authenticated, TORI’s greeting experience should immediately convey a personal touch. Research shows that addressing users by name from the start creates a sense of warmth and personalization
userguiding.com
userguiding.com
. New users and returning users should see different greetings that reflect their relationship with TORI:
New Users: Aim for a light, human-like greeting that feels welcoming but not overly intimate (since they’re just starting out). For example: “Pleasure to meet you, Katelyn. How shall we begin?” – this uses the user’s name and a polite, upbeat tone. The wording “Pleasure” is somewhat formal yet friendly, which can make the AI feel personable. Keep it short and positive. You might also include a one-line tip or CTA for first-timers, like “You can ask me to remember things or upload a document to get started.” However, avoid overwhelming a new user with too much info. It’s been noted that a well-crafted onboarding greeting should feel natural and engaging, giving a concise intro without a deluge of instructions
uxplanet.org
. Many apps use welcome messages on splash screens for first-time users
uxplanet.org
 – TORI could present this greeting on an overlay or hero section of the homepage on the first visit, possibly alongside a brief onboarding tooltip or two. Just ensure that after this friendly hello, new users can easily identify the next step (perhaps a prominent “Upload your first document” button or a highlighted prompt area to start typing a question).
Returning Users: This is where TORI can shine by leveraging long-term memory for a context-aware greeting. The goal is to make the user feel “remembered” every time they come back. Greet them by name and reference something relevant from past interactions – but do so subtly. For example: “Welcome back, Katelyn 😊. Ready to continue with your travel itinerary draft?” or “Hi Katelyn! Hope you’re doing well. I’ve kept your Budget Planner notes handy – shall we pick up where we left off?”. These kinds of greetings demonstrate continuity: TORI recalls the specific document or project name the user last worked on, or an interest the user frequently explores. This continuity creates a small delight in the user’s mind – a well-timed, context-rich greeting can make them think “Oh, my assistant remembered I was working on this, how thoughtful.” which helps build a relationship-like bond between user and assistant
file-bmeimbwhtcv9w7gogiwqmj
. Personalization experts agree that customizing messages based on whether the user is new or returning deepens engagement
hotjar.com
. Even something simple like greeting by first name and acknowledging their return (“Good to see you again”) signals that the experience is tailored for them
userguiding.com
.
To implement dynamic greetings, TORI’s system should store key user context (with user consent). This might include: last opened document or concept, topics of interest, even a note about the user’s mood if that’s something TORI tracks (e.g. if the user often logs mood in the journal). With a robust memory store, you can pull a relevant snippet each session. For instance, if TORI has a memory of the user mentioning they felt “stressed about project X” last time, the greeting could gently acknowledge that: “Welcome back, Katelyn. I hope you’re feeling better about Project X today – let me know if you want to review your notes.” This shows empathy and continuity without prying too much. Microsoft’s Copilot provides a real-world example of this approach: it introduced a personalized memory feature that retains details like a user’s preferences and milestones, enabling more personalized, context-aware responses over time
geekwire.com
. TORI should do similarly, albeit in a way that aligns with user comfort (perhaps allow users to configure how much TORI should recall or reference in greetings). Tone and subtlety are crucial. The prompt specifically mentions avoiding heavy-handedness, which is wise – if TORI overdoes the familiarity or constantly references personal data, it could feel creepy or intrusive. Design the copy to be warm but not overbearing:
Keep it concise and positive: 1–2 sentences at most for a greeting, so it feels like a gentle nudge rather than a verbose chat. Returning users likely want to get things done, so a quick personalized hello and maybe one suggestion is enough.
Use a consistent voice: TORI’s personality might be described as a “lifelong ambient memory assistant” – likely gentle, observant, and supportive. The language should reflect continuity (“I’ve got your notes from last time”) and optimism (“Ready whenever you are!”). Avoid language that could guilt-trip or pressure the user. For example, if a user hasn’t logged in for a while, TORI might say “Hi Sam, it’s been a little while – I’m here whenever you need me.” rather than “Where have you been? You’ve missed 5 days!”. In fact, if a user has been inactive for a long period, a neutral, inviting greeting is recommended: e.g. “Hello again! It’s been a while – let me know if I can help with anything.” This kind of copy avoids guilt-tripping but still warmly encourages re-engagement
file-bmeimbwhtcv9w7gogiwqmj
.
Contextual accuracy: Make sure any contextual reference is up-to-date and relevant. If TORI references an old project the user finished weeks ago, it might seem out of touch. A good strategy is to reference the most recent significant interaction (last document edited, or a concept they frequently query). If nothing recent is notable, a generic but personable greeting is fine (“Hi Alex, how can I assist today?”). Always fall back to friendliness if specific memory cues aren’t applicable.
From an implementation view, you’ll need conditional logic based on user data. When rendering the homepage, the app could check a user profile object for a flag like isNewUser (set true on first login) or simply check if this is the first session. New users get the default greeting component, while returning users trigger a function to generate a custom greeting string. This function might pull from a “memory” database or API: for example, query the last modified document title, or retrieve a short summary of the user’s recent activity (TORI’s knowledge base might store a list of recent “concepts” the user interacted with). Ensure to update the greeting logic over time as TORI’s relationship with the user evolves. For instance, after multiple sessions, TORI might vary the greeting style a bit to keep it fresh (even something playful like noticing patterns: “Happy Friday, Katelyn! Last Friday we brainstormed recipes – interested in doing that again?”). However, always keep the tone aligned with TORI’s supportive role and do not introduce anything too casual or slangy unless that fits your brand. Consistency in voice builds trust
blog.prototypr.io
. One more subtle UI touch: you could animate or delay the greeting slightly when the user opens the app, to emulate the feeling of a companion coming online. For example, show the greeting text fading in after half a second or with a brief typing indicator, as if TORI is “formulating” the hello. This micro-interaction can make the greeting feel more alive. Just be careful that it doesn’t slow down the perceived performance – it should be a gentle polish, not a hindrance.
Adaptive Home Dashboard with User Memory
After greeting the user, the homepage should adapt to their context and showcase key elements of TORI’s long-term memory. The design challenge is to present useful personal content (recent items, journal, etc.) in an engaging but not overwhelming way. We want the user to feel the system remembers their content and cares about their interests, yet keep the UI clean and focused.
Recent Concepts & Uploaded Documents
One section of the home screen can surface the user’s recent concepts and uploaded documents. These could be presented as small cards or a list:
Recent Concepts: If TORI helps the user capture concepts or ideas (perhaps extracted keywords or topics from their interactions), list a few of the latest ones. For example, show the title of a concept or a concise snippet describing it. This acts as a shortcut for the user to revisit or build upon those ideas. A label like “Recently Captured Ideas” or “Recent Concepts” can head this section. Each item might show an icon (indicating its type or source), a title, and maybe a date. If clicked, it could open the detailed view of that concept or related chat. If the user is brand new and has no concepts yet, utilize an empty state here with a friendly prompt: e.g. “No concepts yet — start a conversation or upload a document, and your key ideas will appear here!”. Empty states help onboard users by explaining the feature in situ
userguiding.com
.
Uploaded Documents: Similar to recent concepts, display a few of the most recently uploaded or accessed documents. This could be represented with file-type icons (PDF, doc, etc.) and the filename or a user-given title. If TORI generates summaries for uploaded files, you might even show a one-line summary or the most relevant concept from each document as a subtitle. For instance: “Project Plan.pdf – concept: Timeline Optimization”. This immediately reminds the user what each file is about. Again, if none exist yet, an empty state invites action: “You haven’t uploaded anything yet. Try dropping a PDF here – I’ll remember it for you.”. Consider adding an “Upload” button or drag-and-drop target directly in this section for convenience (perhaps only visible when no docs are present, or always available as a small icon in the section header).
Layout-wise, these could be arranged in a two-column grid of cards if space permits, or a vertical list. For a dashboard feel, cards with light background and a gentle shadow can separate these sections. Keep the sections visually distinct but coherent – perhaps each has a small header text, and the cards use TORI’s accent color for highlights or icons to maintain the brand feel.
Reflective Journal Snippet
The reflective journal is a special, personal feature – we want it to be emotionally resonant yet subtle and respectful. A design strategy here is to show only a single meaningful sentence or snippet from the user’s journal on the homepage, as a gentle prompt of their self-reflections. Think of it like a “thought of the day” pulled from their own past entries. For example, if the user keeps a journal with TORI, you could display something like: *“*💭 ‘I feel more confident after finishing the budget report.’ – Journal entry from 2 days ago” This kind of snippet can give the user a moment of reflection or pride, and it feels very personal because it’s literally their own words or feelings. It’s akin to how some wellness apps display a daily quote or affirmation, except here it’s coming from the user’s own journal, which can be even more powerful. Apple’s new Journal app follows a similar philosophy: it isn’t about long diary entries on the screen at once, but rather quick snippets of text that help users reflect on their life and mental state
forums.appleinsider.com
. By showing just a line or two, TORI can evoke emotion (“oh right, I wrote that, and I have overcome that challenge”) without exposing the full journal (maintaining some privacy in case someone else glances at the screen). Design the journal snippet module with care: it could be a stylized quote box or a subtle italic text section. Perhaps prepend a small icon (💭 or 📓) to indicate this is from the journal. Only show this if the user has at least one journal entry. If not, you might not show anything, or show a very minimal prompt like “Consider writing a short reflection – your thoughts will appear here for you next time.” However, because journaling is very personal, it might be better to leave it blank or opt-in. One idea is to let users control whether the journal snippet appears on the home screen (some might consider their journal very private). TORI could have a setting toggle like “Show my journal reflection on home screen”. This gives privacy-conscious users control. If enabled, then on each visit, show the latest entry snippet or even rotate through past insightful sentences. Keep the tone gentle: we want it to feel like a nudge from a friend, not an app feature announcement. For instance, a subtle introductory text like “From your journal:” in a lighter font before the snippet can frame it. Emotional resonance through UI: to make this snippet truly feel special but subtle, consider using a slightly different styling than the rest of the dashboard. Maybe it’s in a faint cursive font or a softer color, to distinguish it from the “utility” info like documents. This visually cues that it’s a personal thought. But don't overdo it – it still should align with the overall design. A slight italic or a gentle background highlight could suffice. Remember, emotional design is often about the little details: perhaps the snippet fades in on load, which might metaphorically suggest a memory resurfacing gently. In making the journal snippet subtle, we also ensure it’s not distracting. It should occupy a small region (maybe a single-line height or a small card) and not push more immediately actionable content (like recent files) out of view.
Layout Best Practices
For an onboarding-focused UI with long-term memory features, balance the layout between guidance and content. A possible structure for the home screen when logged in:
Top: Greeting header (e.g. a full-width banner or simply a section at the top of the page with the personalized greeting text). If TORI has a avatar or logo that “speaks,” you might place a small avatar icon next to the greeting to accentuate the assistant’s presence. Keep this area compact (one or two lines of text) so it doesn’t hog screen space on subsequent visits.
Body: a flexible grid or list of the content sections (recent concepts, documents, journal). On desktop, you might use a two-column layout: for example, left column for “Recent Concepts” and “Your Documents” (stacked vertically), and a right column for the journal snippet and maybe one more widget (like a “Tip of the day” or an “Upcoming reminder” if such exists). On mobile, these would naturally stack vertically in a single column. Use responsive design to ensure it looks good on different screen sizes – perhaps each section is a card that can collapse.
Navigation/UI chrome: If TORI is a web app, you’ll have a top nav or sidebar that includes things like the user’s profile menu (for account settings, etc.), and maybe quick access to other sections (e.g. a link to “All Concepts” or “All Documents” library). However, since this is an assistant interface, consider keeping navigation minimal to maintain focus on the personalized content. A common approach is a simple header bar with a menu or icon on the right for profile/settings and maybe an on-screen toggle to open the assistant chat interface.
During the first-run onboarding, some of these sections might be empty – use that opportunity to guide the user. We already discussed empty states with helpful text. Additionally, you might include a one-time tour or gentle highlight for key UI elements. For example, a small tooltip pointing to the “Upload” button saying “Upload documents for me to remember and summarize” can be very effective. Just ensure this only appears for new users and not for returning users who already know it (the system should remember not to show the same tutorial twice – you can set a flag in the user profile or local storage that onboarding is complete
uxplanet.org
). Another best practice is progressive disclosure – don’t show every single feature at once to a new user. TORI likely has a lot of capabilities (concept extraction, journaling, persona editing, etc.), but dumping all those on day one could be overwhelming. Design the home UI to emphasize what’s most important for getting started (probably uploading content or asking a question). Other features can be introduced gradually via subtle UI hints or when the user navigates to those sections. For instance, the journal feature might not even be shown until the user writes their first journal entry; or it could be present but low-key (like “Journal (0 entries)” link). This aligns with the idea of segmenting onboarding based on usage – first focus on core usage, then reveal deeper features as the user becomes more engaged

Intimate Design Language & Micro-Interactions
To reinforce TORI’s role as a lifelong ambient memory assistant, the design language (both visual and textual) should exude intimacy, continuity, and trust. This involves everything from the wording of UI text to small animations that give a sense of a living assistant. Here are some recommendations:
UX Copy that Connects: Use first-person and second-person pronouns in a friendly manner (e.g. “I’ve saved your summary” or “Let me know how I can help”). The assistant’s voice should be consistent – likely polite, thoughtful, and encouraging. It should not feel like a formal tool, but rather a companion. For example, instead of a generic system message like “No documents found,” TORI might say “You haven’t added any documents yet – I’m ready to remember whatever you upload 😊.” Notice the use of an emoji – a light touch of emotion can make the AI feel more human, but use sparingly and only where appropriate. Aim for a tone that is empathetic and reassuring, especially since TORI deals with personal memories. When referencing past user data, phrase it positively: “I remember you were interested in European history. I found a new article you might like.” This shows continuity of interest. Always avoid any language that might come across as judgmental or too pushy. The content from the prior user research emphasizes that well-timed, context-aware cues can foster a feeling of being cared for
file-bmeimbwhtcv9w7gogiwqmj
. A small friendly reminder like “I noticed you were working late yesterday, hope you got some rest!” could delight the user – but such messages should be used with caution and only if the user has opted into “mood/mindful” features, to avoid feeling invasive.
Micro-interactions & Transitions: Smooth transitions can express continuity. For instance, after login (especially first login), instead of a jarring jump cut, fade the screen into the home dashboard while displaying a welcome message. A quick example: after a new user signs up, you could briefly show TORI’s logo or icon with a “handwave” animation and a “Welcome, Katelyn!” for a second, then transition to the main screen greeting. This creates a moment of intimacy, as if TORI is personally acknowledging the user’s arrival. Similarly, when the user returns, the greeting text might appear with a tiny delay or a slide-in effect, suggesting TORI is proactively greeting them. Keep these transitions fast and unobtrusive (no one likes waiting on long animations), but done right they add a subtle emotional layer.
Continuity in Visuals: Consider maintaining some element on screen that represents TORI’s continuous presence. This could be a small avatar icon or an ambient background element that subtly changes based on context (for example, a soft gradient that shifts color tone between morning and night, or a minimal animation that responds when TORI “speaks”). This is akin to ambient devices that give off a gentle glow or movement to indicate activity. It reinforces that TORI is always there in the background as a supportive presence.
Intimate UI Components: Some UI elements can be designed to feel more personal rather than utilitarian. For example, instead of a plain notification badge (“3 new updates”), TORI might have a message center that says “Here’s what I’ve prepared for you” when clicked, using a conversational tone. When the user completes a task or writes a journal entry, a little positive reinforcement can go a long way: a subtle congratulatory message like “Great work today! I’ve saved this in your journal 👍” accompanied by a pleasant little animation (maybe a checkmark morphing into a smiley) can make the experience feel rewarding without being gamey. The idea is to infuse moments of delight that acknowledge the user personally.
Respecting Boundaries: Intimacy in design should always respect user boundaries. Always provide an option to turn off certain personalizations or greetings if the user prefers a more stoic interface. For instance, allow them to disable the daily greeting or journal snippet if they find it unnecessary. This keeps the user in control, which ultimately builds trust.
Finally, ensure that the design language aligns with TORI’s core value: being a “lifelong ambient memory assistant.” This implies longevity and subtlety. The UI should feel calm, reliable, and smart. Long-term use means it should not be flashy or tiring to look at; a clean design with a soft color palette (perhaps blues or greens for calm, or a dark mode for evening use) would be appropriate. Ambient means TORI is there when needed but not in your face when not – triggers and prompts should feel like gentle taps on the shoulder, not shouts
file-bmeimbwhtcv9w7gogiwqmj
. For example, TORI could use a small notification or highlight if there’s something new (like “You have a new concept from yesterday’s reading”), but these should be subtle and maybe batch together rather than constant pop-ups. In summary, building TORI’s login and onboarding with these strategies will create an experience where users feel personally welcomed and remembered every time. By combining conditional UI rendering, dynamic personalized greetings, a memory-infused home dashboard, and a gentle, intimate design language, TORI can position itself not just as an app, but as a comforting personal assistant that grows with the user. The payoff is a “sticky” user experience where people return frequently because it feels like TORI understands and values them

. When users sense that continuity – that the assistant remembers their name, their projects, even a snippet of how they felt – it fosters loyalty and trust. As one onboarding best-practice guide noted, personalization (even something as simple as using the first name) from the earliest touchpoints contributes greatly to user loyalty
userguiding.com
userguiding.com
. TORI’s design should take that to the next level, leveraging long-term memory to make each session feel like a seamless continuation of the last. With thoughtful UI components and careful implementation of conditional rendering and identity tools, you can achieve a welcoming, emotionally engaging experience that remains elegant and respectful throughout the user’s journey with TORI.
