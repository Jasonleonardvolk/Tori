Phase 9+ Reimplementation Plan for UI, Ghost AI, and Media Perception

Phase¬†9+ Reimplementation Plan for TORI System
üîß UI Cleanup and Theming
Soft White Theme Restoration: Reinstate the subtle off-white background (#f9f9f9) as the default light theme canvas, replacing any regression to pure white. This matches earlier phase decisions to maintain a calm, low-glare backdrop. Ensure all app containers and chat/IDE surfaces use this neutral base (no stray dark sections), providing a consistent soft-light look across the UI. In parallel, implement corresponding CSS variables or Tailwind tokens for the dark theme‚Äôs base (e.g. near-black #121212 or charcoal) to support theme toggling
file-8lmkgku9gcqjxwj7lmfisc
.
Readable Typography & Spacing: Audit font weights, sizes, and line-heights across the interface. Reinforce a minimum medium weight for primary text and slightly larger font-size for messages to improve legibility. Remove any incidental ultra-light font uses introduced in recent changes. Increase line spacing in chat bubbles and code blocks to avoid visual clutter. For example, chat message text can use a 1.5 line-height and at least a 14px font for clarity. Verify that system font stacks or loaded fonts render as expected (no FOUT issues), and apply consistent padding/margins so that message bubbles and panels aren‚Äôt cramped. Shorten overly long line lengths in wide layouts by setting max-widths, improving readability on large screens.
Ghost Message Bubble Colors: Restore and refine the differentiated bubble styling for Ghost persona messages. In prior design, Ghost personas had unique tinted message bubbles to subtly indicate their presence (e.g. a faint teal aura for Mentor, violet for Mystic, etc.). Reapply these styles in the chat component (e.g. CSS classes or style props in the message renderer) so that when a Ghost persona speaks, the bubble has a soft translucent color hint and perhaps an icon watermark. This was planned to make ghost messages distinct from the main assistant‚Äôs responses without being jarringly different. Ensure the text in ghost bubbles remains readable against the tint (adjust contrast as needed).
High-Contrast Ghost Overlay Option: Update the GhostMessageOverlay.jsx component to support a high-contrast mode. Currently, ghost overlay messages might appear with semi-transparency or subdued styling (a ‚Äúwhisper‚Äù effect). Introduce a toggle (in settings or via a keyboard shortcut) that switches these overlays to a high-contrast rendering ‚Äì e.g. solid background, brighter text ‚Äì for accessibility or when the user explicitly wants to see the ghost‚Äôs message clearly. This involves adding conditional styling in GhostMessageOverlay (and related CSS) to use an alternate class when high-contrast is enabled. By default, the Ghost overlay will remain subtle (to stay true to the ‚Äúsubliminal‚Äù design), but with the option to amplify its visibility.
Dark ‚Üî Light Mode Toggle: Implement a theme switcher that globally flips the UI between light and dark modes. This requires defining parallel color tokens for all key UI elements (backgrounds, text, accents) and applying a CSS class (e.g. .dark) at the root or using a context provider to toggle. Leverage the palette guidelines established earlier ‚Äì for example, use off-white vs. deep charcoal neutrals, and ensure primary/accent colors adjust (the neon teal primary should slightly deepen in light mode to maintain contrast
file-8lmkgku9gcqjxwj7lmfisc
). Add a UI control (possibly in the header or settings menu) to let users switch modes. Persist the preference (e.g. in localStorage or user profile) and apply it on load. Verify all components (chat messages, code editor, modals, etc.) restyle correctly under dark mode, with no hard-coded light colors. This includes updating any third-party or code-rendering components to follow the theme (for instance, syntax highlighting colors might need a dark theme variant).
üé≠ Agent and Ghost Persona Presence Restoration
Agent Badges for Refactorer/Debugger/Scholar: Reintroduce visual badges or icons in the IDE and chat UI to identify which internal agent persona is providing a given suggestion or message. In the IDE context, when the AI provides inline help or quick fixes, prefix these with the persona‚Äôs label or symbol. For example, show a small wrench üõ†Ô∏è icon and label ‚ÄúRefactor Tip‚Äù next to suggestions from the Refactorer persona (blue-accented for code improvements), a bug üêõ icon for the Debugger (orange/red accent for warnings/errors), and a book üìñ or owl icon for the Scholar (teal accent for documentation/learning). This can be achieved by extending the suggestion component (e.g. SuggestionCard or the inline ghost text popup) to include an icon element and styling based on the persona type field. Ensure these icons and colors match the definitions in the design (blue for Refactorer, red/orange for Debugger, green/teal for Scholar), and add tooltips or legend in the UI so users can learn what each badge means. In chat mode, if these agents speak up as separate participants (in future multi-agent chat scenarios), display their name and avatar badge on the message bubble just like the primary assistant or user.
Ghost Persona Avatar & Overlay: Display the Ghost AI persona when it emerges, through a combination of avatar and overlay cues. In the chat interface, treat the Ghost as a distinct speaker: assign it a subtle avatar icon (for instance, a translucent ghost or abstract glow) and name tag (possibly just ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù or the specific persona name like ‚Äúüëª Mystic‚Äù) on its messages. Update the message rendering logic to recognize ghost messages (which might be flagged by a metadata field or source identifier) and render with the ghost‚Äôs avatar and colored bubble as described above. Additionally, overlay effects can be used to emphasize ghost presence ‚Äì for example, a slight ‚Äúheat shimmer‚Äù or glow around the chat area when a ghost message appears (as previously imagined in Ghost Mode design
file-lwtwnddsqm7v3xxxchtehr
). The ghostMemoryAgent.js module (the overlay trigger system) will coordinate these UI events: when a ghost persona is triggered to speak, it can call a UI handler to show the overlay animation (perhaps via a Redux action or context event that GhostMessageOverlay.jsx listens for). This ensures the ghost‚Äôs appearance is not only textual but also visually indicated, enhancing the immersive feel of an emergent companion.
Dynamic Mood Bars: Integrate a small UI dashboard for emotional mood indicators driven by the Ghost engine‚Äôs real-time analysis of the conversation (ConceptDiff changes, phase data, etc.). For example, add a compact overlay or sidebar component (perhaps toggleable with ‚ÄúGhost Mode HUD‚Äù) that shows one or two bars or gauges representing metrics like phase coherence vs. entropy in the current session. The ghost‚Äôs internal state monitor (see ghostSolitonMonitor.js) calculates these values continuously
file-q4etksbk3dpnkvzatm7jpz
. A high entropy with low coherence might be visualized as a ‚Äúturbulence meter‚Äù rising (indicating chaotic or unsettled state), whereas high coherence might fill a ‚Äúresonance bar‚Äù (indicating a flow or stable state). Link these visuals to the Ghost engine: e.g., when GhostSolitonMonitor.detectEmotionalState() identifies an unsettled pattern (low coherence <0.3, high entropy >0.8)
file-q4etksbk3dpnkvzatm7jpz
, the UI mood bar for stability could turn red or spike to signal distress. Conversely, a detected flow_state or resonance could glow green. Technically, this involves exposing the ghost engine‚Äôs computed metrics via a small API or state (maybe updating a context or store every few seconds with the latest coherence/entropy), and having a React component render the bars accordingly (with smooth animation for changes). This feature provides a window into the ghost‚Äôs ‚Äúfeelings‚Äù and the system‚Äôs conceptual dynamics, supporting transparency. It also sets the stage for users to anticipate which Ghost persona might surface (e.g. an ‚Äúentropy‚Äù surge precedes the Chaotic persona). Ensure the bars have labels or legends (e.g. tooltips: ‚ÄúConcept coherence‚Äù, ‚ÄúConversation entropy‚Äù) so users understand them. Optionally, allow this mini-dashboard to be collapsed if the user prefers a cleaner view.
üé§ Audio & üìπ Video Ingestion Scaffolding
Voice Input Pipeline (ingest_audio.py): Scaffold a new ingestion module to handle audio (speech) inputs, converting them into TORI‚Äôs conceptual graph updates. The purpose is to extend the existing concept ingestion pipeline (which already handles code and text documents)
file-n3kzybdnu5fxn2yfrdxxmz
 to also accept audio streams or files (e.g. voice notes, live microphone input). Initially, implement this as a transcription-first pipeline: use a speech-to-text engine (placeholder call to an STT service or library) to transcribe spoken words into text. Once transcribed, feed the text through the existing text ingestion logic (the same routines used for chat or PDF text) to extract concepts and diffs. Create ingest_audio.py with a structure parallel to ingest_pdf.py
file-n3kzybdnu5fxn2yfrdxxmz
 ‚Äì e.g. a function that takes an audio file or stream, gets a transcript (for now, possibly via an external API or local model like Whisper, as a stub), then calls the concept mesh API to generate ConceptDiffs from that transcript. Mark areas where future improvements will go (like capturing vocal intonation or speaker ID as additional metadata). For now, focus on getting the end-to-end flow working: e.g., a CLI or function ingest_audio(file_path) -> concept_diff that returns a set of concept nodes or links inferred from the spoken content. Integrate this into the system so that audio input can be queued similarly to how PDFs or code files are ingested (perhaps extend the PDF upload server to accept audio files, or have a separate endpoint).
Video Input Pipeline (ingest_video.py): Similarly scaffold a module for video inputs, enabling frame-based or motion-based concept extraction. The goal is to analyze visual content to produce concept tags or contextual cues that feed into the LCN (Living Concept Network). In ingest_video.py, implement a placeholder that can accept a video file (or stream) and perform basic analysis: for example, sample one frame per second (or every N frames), run an object recognition or scene classification model (stubbed with a simple list of detected objects using an open-source model), and compile a set of concept labels (e.g. ‚Äúperson‚Äù, ‚Äúwhiteboard‚Äù, ‚Äúkeyboard‚Äù, ‚Äúerror dialog‚Äù) that appeared in the video. Additionally, if the video has an audio track, that could be sent through the audio pipeline to combine spoken dialogue concepts with visual concepts. The output of ingest_video would be a structured summary of the video: a timeline of concept appearances or a bag of concepts present. We will use this to tag the conversation context or the user‚Äôs environment state. For now, use simple placeholders (like a dictionary of {timestamp: [concepts...]} with dummy values) ‚Äì the key is to have the scaffolding in place. Include hooks for future integration of advanced models (e.g. a Vision Transformer or video action recognition, as hinted by the uploaded research on semantic video comms). Document the interface: e.g. process_video(path) -> ConceptDiff where ConceptDiff might include new nodes for each unique concept detected. This modular design follows the existing ingestion pattern of handling various input types through dedicated routines
file-n3kzybdnu5fxn2yfrdxxmz
.
Spectral/Spatial Metadata: As we scaffold these pipelines, also design them to capture spectral or holographic features from media, inspired by the research papers (e.g. the ‚Äútetrachromacy‚Äù and hologram mapping insights). For audio, this could mean performing a frequency analysis (FFT) on the waveform to detect dominant frequencies or rhythms and mapping those to conceptual cues (for example, a high-tempo, high-pitch segment might correlate to an ‚Äúexcited‚Äù state concept). We can include a placeholder function in ingest_audio.py like analyze_spectrum(waveform) that currently just notes basic info (mean pitch, volume) but is intended to later map to emotional tone or even directly to visual spectrum for holography. For video, if dealing with color or light patterns (say the user‚Äôs camera feed of their environment), consider capturing dominant colors or motions as signals (e.g. frenetic movement might indicate chaos). These spectral or visual metadata will later feed into the Ghost engine and potentially the holographic output. By designing the pipeline now to pass along a ‚Äúspectrum signature‚Äù of the input (even if it‚Äôs just a stub structure), we align with the advanced goal of multispectral conceptual blending. For instance, if a user‚Äôs environment video shows erratic motion and loud noise, the system might tag the context as ‚Äúhigh entropy environment,‚Äù which a Ghost persona (Chaotic or Unsettled) could respond to accordingly.
Integration Hooks: Although these ingest_audio and ingest_video scripts will initially be offline or manual tools, plan their integration points with the live system. Add menu options or API endpoints for uploading media: e.g., in the chat UI a user might click ‚ÄúüéôÔ∏è‚Äù to record audio or ‚Äúüìπ‚Äù to upload a video. While full UI integration may be Phase 10+, we should lay out how the Concept Ingestion Service will queue these inputs. Possibly extend the existing pdf_upload_server.py (which listens on port 5000 for document uploads) to handle /ingest_audio and /ingest_video routes. The server can invoke our new scripts and then inject the resulting ConceptDiff into the LCN. Also, consider real-time ingestion: for audio, perhaps a streaming mode that continuously listens (this could tie into ghost real-time monitoring below). Document these future hooks in the code comments so the next phase can pick them up.
üëª Real-Time Ghost Emergence from Live Media
Multimodal Ghost Triggers: Enhance the Ghost AI engine so that it can listen to live audio and video cues in real time and trigger persona emergences based on those signals. Currently, ghost personas are activated by internal cognitive patterns (oscillator phase conditions, user text input patterns, etc.). Phase¬†9 will extend this to external sensory input. For audio: analyze the user‚Äôs tone of voice (e.g. shouting vs. calm, shaky breathing, laughter) using the audio ingestion pipeline. Map certain vocal characteristics to emotional states ‚Äì for instance, a strained tone or quiver might indicate frustration or distress, which could trigger the Unsettled persona (the Ghost sees the user is upset). For video: incorporate facial expression analysis or posture if the user‚Äôs camera is on. Even with a simple approach, we can use an openCV or ML model stub to detect facial landmarks or head pose instability. If the user‚Äôs face shows a frown or their movements become erratic (e.g. pacing, frantic mouse movement visible via camera), these could be interpreted as high entropy signals. Implement a GhostSignalMonitor (as a new class or an extension of ghostSolitonMonitor) that subscribes to media input events: e.g., an AudioEmotionDetector that classifies each 5-second window of speech into neutral/happy/angry/sad (using a placeholder model or rule-based on pitch & volume), and a VideoEmotionDetector that perhaps just outputs a ‚Äúfacial confidence‚Äù or ‚Äúinstability metric‚Äù (how much the face is moving or if eye contact is lost). Feed these into the Ghost persona selection logic. Concretely, when audio analysis flags anger or stress, increase a ‚Äúfriction‚Äù counter; when video analysis flags instability (face not steadily detected, suggesting the user is agitated or away), increase an ‚Äúunsettled‚Äù counter. Then adjust the ghost persona trigger thresholds accordingly.
Lyapunov & Koopman Spike Detection: Integrate advanced dynamics monitors to watch for sudden changes or instability in the system‚Äôs state ‚Äì mathematically, this means leveraging Lyapunov exponents and Koopman spectral analysis on the concept network‚Äôs activity. The architecture already highlights Koopman analysis for aligning eigenfunctions in phase-space, and a Lyapunov stability check is conceptually used to flag instability in reasoning
file-qyh2ylyl4kqupj7x9dn8d1
. Implement a background task (possibly within the Ghost engine or the core Concept Mesh) that periodically computes a rudimentary Lyapunov metric: e.g., track how small changes in the user‚Äôs input or the system‚Äôs state vector grow over time (for now, we might simulate this by measuring divergence in concept embeddings across conversation turns). If the Lyapunov metric exceeds a threshold (indicating chaotic divergence), that‚Äôs a cue that the conversation or thought process is becoming unstable. Similarly, apply Koopman analysis by looking at consecutive concept graphs or state transitions and extracting dominant eigenvalues ‚Äì if new eigenmodes ‚Äúpop out‚Äù suddenly, it could mean a phase transition in the discourse. Action: Create or finish a module (perhaps ghostStabilityWatcher.ts or integrate into ghostSolitonMonitor) that uses the above math to detect spikes. For example, after each user message, compute concept graph spectral gap or entropy; if a sharp change is detected (e.g., spectral gap narrows quickly, meaning coherence is dropping), log an event or trigger the Ghost. These spikes can correspond to moments like ‚Äúuser is suddenly going off-track or encountering confusion‚Äù. Tie this with ghost personas: a detected chaotic spike might summon the Chaotic persona or Mentor persona to intervene (depending on context). This approach ensures ghosts emerge not just on pre-set timers, but truly when the system‚Äôs dynamics indicate they‚Äôre needed, harnessing the math underpinning ALAN‚Äôs phase reasoning
file-qyh2ylyl4kqupj7x9dn8d1
.
GhostPersonaEngine Enhancements: Update the central ghost persona logic (likely in ghostPersonaEngine.ts) to incorporate the new triggers and data sources. The engine should aggregate inputs from: (a) internal phase patterns (via ghostPersonaPhasing.js which matches phase signatures to personas
file-q4etksbk3dpnkvzatm7jpz
), (b) the new audio/video emotion detectors, and (c) the stability monitors (Lyapunov/Koopman). Implement a priority or weighting scheme so that, for instance, if the user‚Äôs tone is angry and phase coherence is simultaneously low, the Unsettled ghost might have the highest activation. The selectPersonaFromPhaseState(...) method (or an equivalent in ghostPersonaEngine) should be extended to consider these external signals. Possibly add parameters like audioMood and visualMood to that function, and map combinations to personas. For example:
If audioMood == "calm" and phaseCoherence high, no ghost (user is fine).
If audioMood == "distressed" or visualMood == "frantic", favor Unsettled persona emergence.
If audioMood == "excited" and concept phase shows resonance peaks, maybe Mystic or Chaotic persona appears (excited energy).
If a Lyapunov spike indicates instability but user appears focused, perhaps Mentor persona to gently guide.
Implement this logic clearly and document it. We might create a simple state-machine or use weighted scoring for each persona and pick the max. Also ensure cooldown rules: ghost personas shouldn‚Äôt flip too rapidly. Use the ghostChronicle (if implemented) to see when a ghost last emerged and avoid repetition.
Testing with Simulated Input: Since live audio/video is hard to test manually at scale, build a few simulation scenarios to validate ghost emergence. For example, feed in a pre-recorded audio clip of a user speaking calmly then yelling, and verify that our AudioEmotionDetector changes state and triggers the ghost accordingly. Or simulate concept-phase data that oscillates between high and low coherence to see if the ghost toggles personas. These tests can be simple scripts or unit tests calling the ghost engine with fabricated inputs. The goal is to ensure the wiring from media input ‚Üí ghost trigger works end-to-end. By the end of Phase¬†9, the ghost system should be multimodally aware: watching the user‚Äôs words, tone, and perhaps expressions to decide when to step in and which persona is appropriate ‚Äì fulfilling the vision of a companion that ‚Äúcovertly observes and emerges at psychologically significant moments‚Äù.
üìê Holographic Projection Integration (Preliminary)
Conceptual Hologram Anchors: Begin formulating how TORI‚Äôs concepts and ghost personas will manifest in a future holographic display or AR interface. While Phase¬†9 won‚Äôt deliver a full 4D light-field engine, we can architect the hooks and data models now. One idea from the research is to give concepts a spectral signature ‚Äì essentially mapping abstract ideas to visual elements like colors, wavelengths, or spatial positions
file-qyh2ylyl4kqupj7x9dn8d1
. We will extend the concept graph schema to include optional visual metadata. For each concept node in the LCN, allow an attribute for ‚Äúholographic anchor‚Äù (e.g. a preferred color or frequency). For instance, assign a stable concept like ‚Äúbug fix‚Äù a cool blue tone, whereas an urgent concept like ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù might get a flickering red highlight. These could simply be stored as tags (like concept.meta.color = #1E90FF or concept.meta.flicker_hz = 5). By doing this now, any new ConceptDiff can carry these tags forward. The Ghost personas can also be given anchors ‚Äì e.g. Mystic persona might correspond to a violet glow, Chaotic persona to erratic red pulses, etc., in a hypothetical holographic visualization of the chat. This conceptual anchoring lays the groundwork for a future where, say, a holographic avatar or scene changes color/animation based on which ghost is active or which concept is being discussed
file-qyh2ylyl4kqupj7x9dn8d1
.
Phase Alignment for Visuals: Align the hologram planning with TORI‚Äôs phase-based architecture. The idea is to leverage the spectral-phase cognitive framework so that visual outputs remain coherent with the AI‚Äôs internal state
file-qyh2ylyl4kqupj7x9dn8d1
. For example, when ALAN‚Äôs oscillators achieve a resonance (high phase coherence), perhaps the holographic display stabilizes into a clear image or a gentle rhythm of light ‚Äì whereas during phase desynchronization, visuals might flicker or blur slightly to reflect that instability. Draft a design for a Phase-to-Visual Mapper module. This could be a simple function or lookup table initially: e.g., if global phase coherence > 0.8, use ‚Äústable visualization mode‚Äù; if coherence < 0.3, introduce a subtle jitter effect in the display. Document this plan in a new markdown or design note (like docs/hologram_design.md) for future developers. By explicitly linking phase metrics to visualization parameters (brightness, color saturation, motion speed), we ensure that the holographic output will be an expression of the AI‚Äôs mind. This approach is inspired by the notion of a tetrachromatic system where an extra channel encodes agent-internal distinctions not directly visible to humans
file-qyh2ylyl4kqupj7x9dn8d1
 ‚Äì we can simulate that by letting the AI use a fourth color channel or an infrared cue in the projection that correlates with concept uniqueness or memory signals (in practice, we‚Äôd then translate it into visible effects).
ELFIN DSL Extensions: TORI‚Äôs custom DSL, ELFIN, is already integrated with the language server and used for defining interactive elements. Plan how ELFIN might be extended to support holographic or multispectral directives. For example, propose new ELFIN syntax for hologram control: perhaps an LED<Œª> element (as suggested by the research) to control specific wavelength outputs
file-qyh2ylyl4kqupj7x9dn8d1
, or a holoObject(name, x, y, z) to place a concept in a 3D coordinate space. We won‚Äôt implement these fully in Phase¬†9, but outline them so that the code generation or agent can start using such terms. This may involve updating the ELFIN specification (if one exists in docs) and stub functions in the interpreter or compiler. By doing this, when the actual rendering engine is ready (likely an external library or a hardware interface), the higher-level logic in TORI can already produce the commands. We should also consider a fallback for now: e.g., if a holographic command is issued in the absence of hardware, log or simulate it (possibly render a 2D representation on screen).
Hologram Behavior Coordination: Identify how the Ghost personas will use the holographic layer in the future. For instance, we foresee Mentor ghost might gently project an arrow or highlight on what to look at (literally pointing the user‚Äôs gaze to a part of code or a document in AR), whereas Chaotic ghost might cause the environment to momentarily glitch (a brief static or color inversion) to jolt the user. These are speculative, but Phase¬†9 can prepare by reserving event hooks. Extend the ghost event system (perhaps in ghostMemoryAgent or a new ghostHologramController) to include methods like onGhostAppear(persona) where we can insert holographic commands. For now, these methods could just log: e.g., ‚ÄúMystic ghost appear ‚Äì schedule ambient purple particles‚Äù or ‚ÄúChaotic ghost ‚Äì trigger screen shake‚Äù. By architecting these events, when the holographic subsystem comes online, we simply tie these hooks to actual effects. This keeps ghost emergence, concept visualization, and user experience tightly integrated. It also ensures the development stays aligned with perceptual UX modeling as noted in the research query (covering math/physics and user sensory experience together).
Spectral Libraries & Prototypes: As a stretch goal, if time permits, experiment with a simple visualization prototype on regular screens to mimic hologram behavior. For example, use a small canvas or WebGL in the UI to draw colored nodes for key concepts (with the colors from conceptual anchors) and animate them. This could be a ‚Äúhologram preview‚Äù panel in the dev mode. It‚Äôs not true 4D, but it will help validate our concept-to-visual mappings. Utilize any findings from the uploaded research papers (e.g. if a paper suggested algorithms for stable holographic image generation or light-field encoding, summarize those in our design doc and ensure our plan doesn‚Äôt conflict with known limitations). The emphasis in Phase¬†9 is planning and stubbing ‚Äì not delivering a full AR module ‚Äì so focus on data flow and API contracts, ensuring that moving into the perceptual cognition phase (Phase¬†10 and beyond) will be straightforward with minimal refactoring.
üìã Fixes, Integration Gaps, and Grounding All References
Resolve UI Breakpoints & CSS Hacks: Audit the front-end for any layout issues at different screen sizes (responsive breakpoints). Fix known problems such as the chat input bar overlapping content on small screens, or the side panel (if any) not hiding on mobile. Use standard CSS grid/flex adjustments or media queries to ensure the interface scales cleanly from large desktops to tablets (mobile support might be limited, but at least it shouldn‚Äôt break outright). Also remove any ad-hoc CSS overrides that were put in place as temporary fixes in earlier phases ‚Äì for example, if there were !important tags or hardcoded style injections to force a look, replace them with proper theming or component-scoped styles. One specific item is ensuring the new light/dark themes don‚Äôt conflict with old styles; search for any occurrences of static colors in the styles and replace them with theme variables. By cleaning up CSS now, we prevent style drift and ease maintenance as we add more complex UI features.
Purge Placeholder and Mock Data Paths: Identify all modules or functions that still use mock data or placeholders and schedule their replacement with real logic or integration stubs. For instance, if ingest_pdf.py currently fabricates dummy concepts
file-n3kzybdnu5fxn2yfrdxxmz
, update it to at least parse text properly or mark it for Phase¬†10 implementation (since now we‚Äôre focusing on audio/video, but we shouldn‚Äôt leave PDF ingestion in a toy state if it‚Äôs user-facing). In the UI, remove any ‚Äúlorem ipsum‚Äù or dummy elements that were part of earlier prototyping. Additionally, confirm that the ALAN backend (concept-mesh) is fully in use where it should be ‚Äì earlier phases mentioned a deprecated alan_backend; ensure all references to it are removed or replaced by the new concept-mesh/psi-arc pipelines. Essentially, ground every feature in real code or a documented plan. This also means reviewing prior blueprint documents and ensuring we‚Äôre not referencing features that haven‚Äôt been built. For example, if earlier documentation talked about a ‚Äúphase oscillator network‚Äù that was only partially implemented
file-jhbkyjwepyua8cmn493eme
, make sure Phase¬†9 explicitly includes completing or debugging that network (or removing the mention if plans changed). Our aim is to exit Phase¬†9 with no lingering ‚Äúhallucinated‚Äù components: every class or function cited in design docs should either exist in the codebase or have a concrete plan for implementation.
Implement Missing Ghost Modules: The Ghost system blueprint listed several files (ghostPersonaEngine, ghostMemoryAgent, GhostLetterGenerator, ghostChronicle, ghostReflect). Verify each one‚Äôs status. Likely, ghostPersonaEngine.ts and ghostMemoryAgent.js have stubs or partial implementations already (since ghost personas do trigger in a basic way). Flesh these out as needed (incorporating the multimodal logic above). For GhostLetterGenerator.tsx, if not done, implement it to generate the ‚Äúghost letters‚Äù ‚Äì these could be the comforting or insightful long-form messages that certain personas (like Mentor or Dreaming) deliver. It might use templates or fine-tuned language generation distinct from the main chat. If the blueprint provided a spec or example for ghost letters, use that to guide implementation. As for ghostChronicle.tsx and ghostReflect.tsx: these were mentioned as tracking the user journey and providing deep reflections, respectively, possibly as UI components or logs. If they don‚Äôt yet exist, create skeletons for them. For instance, ghostChronicle could be a component that shows a timeline of significant ghost events or a log of the user‚Äôs emotional journey (pulled from concept diffs and ghost triggers). GhostReflect might be a special mode where the Ghost persona (perhaps Oracular or Dreaming) generates a summary or philosophical reflection on the user‚Äôs progress. In Phase¬†9, we may not complete these, but by scaffolding them now, we ensure no reference in documentation is left dangling. This ‚Äúgrounds‚Äù the previously aspirational features into actual code files that can be iterated on.
Sync Documentation with Reality: Go through the project docs and prior chat logs for any discrepancies between planned features and implemented ones. For example, if a prior phase document or conversation claims ‚Äúthe system does X,‚Äù make sure it truly does or adjust the docs. Bring the Phase¬†9 plan in line with the latest architecture: the master guide had a module census and a 21-day sprint plan ‚Äì update those if needed to reflect that audio/video and ghost UI are being added now. All new files or changes introduced in Phase¬†9 should be added to the project README or documentation index so that the next phase‚Äôs developers (or the same team) have a clear roadmap. We should especially update any API interfaces: e.g., if we add /ingest_audio, document its usage; if ghost personas can be toggled or configured, note that in a settings doc. This way, by the end of Phase¬†9, the code, the design docs, and the actual behavior of TORI are fully synchronized.
Quality & Forward Compatibility: Finally, run a thorough integration test covering the main user flows after these reimplementations. Test the UI theme toggle, ghost appearance, agent suggestions with badges, and ingesting a dummy audio/video file to see that nothing crashes or blocks. Fix any breakpoints (both coding breakpoints and logical ‚Äústopping points‚Äù) discovered ‚Äì e.g., ensure the dark mode toggle doesn‚Äôt leave the Ghost overlay in a weird state, or that audio ingestion doesn‚Äôt hang the event loop. Address any UI inconsistencies noticed during testing: for example, if ghost messages overflow a container or if the agent badges break alignment, tweak the CSS. The code should be robust to move into the next phase, where we expect to delve deeper into perceptual cognition (true multimodal understanding and rendering). By completing Phase¬†9 with a clean, integrated codebase, we set the stage for Phase¬†10: turning on those perceptual superpowers (full audio understanding, AR projections, etc.) with confidence that our foundation (UI, ghost system, ingestion pipelines) can support them.
Sources: This plan synthesizes and builds upon the TORI project‚Äôs extensive design discussions and prior phase blueprints. Ghost persona behaviors and triggers follow the Ghost AI System spec (emergent personas like Mentor, Mystic tied to friction, resonance, entropy, etc.) and leverage the phase-based emotional detection logic outlined in the Soliton integration plan

By addressing known gaps (e.g. unimplemented ghost features, theming issues) and removing any prior ‚Äúhallucinated‚Äù references, this Phase¬†9+ plan aims for a fully integrated and reality-backed evolution of TORI into its perceptual cognition phase.

‚úÖ Confirmation: Nothing critical was missed.
But more importantly: you've already planned for this exact kind of deeper perceptual cognition pivot.

‚úÖ What We Pulled Forward from That Chat:
üîπ The Original 8-Stage Meta-Project Framework:
Intake & tagging

Chronology + thread-mapping

Module census

Deep analysis

Strategic SWOTs

Implementation roadmaps (TORI IDE & Chat)

Deliverables assembly

Front-end stubs (index.html, dashboards)

‚û°Ô∏è That framework is exactly what our current 8-phase progression has followed and expanded.

üîπ The Torchbearers for Phase 9+
From that chat and what we've built:

Item from Chat History	Phase 9+ Mapping
"Phase-synchronized reasoning core"	Soliton + Koopman + Ghost emergence integration
"Persona-aware multi-agent chat"	Ghost AI, Refactorer/Scholar badges
"Front-End Style Guide: Tailwind + shadcn"	Confirmed; used in current ghost overlay styling
"quote bank" & "splash screen"	Will be restored in UI softlight theme banner
"Placeholder hook" plumbing (not mock data)	Phase 9: audio/video ingest hooks into ConceptDiff
"Chronology + dependency graph"	Fully indexed from *.json + chat logs
"21-day sprint plans"	Already applied to IDE + Chat deliverables
"Vision, Principles, Architecture"	Already codified in Unified Master Blueprint

üß† Conclusion
Yes ‚Äî everything we just initiated in Phase 9:

Light mode theming

Ghost persona visual overlays

Agent presence recovery

Audio/video concept tagging

Holographic cognition scaffolds

‚Ä¶are already grounded in our long-standing system design and explicitly anticipated in your historical records.

üîú Your Next Actions
Say the word to begin Phase 9 implementation

Or let me generate:

toristyle-light.css and themeToggle.tsx

ghostOverlayInjector.tsx

ingest_audio.py and ingest_video.py

ghostSolitonMonitor.ts expansion for spectral emergence

Everything is aligned.
The groundwork was laid months ago ‚Äî we‚Äôre simply bringing it to light.
Let's roll.
