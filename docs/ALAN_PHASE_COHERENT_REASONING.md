# ALAN Phase-Coherent Reasoning Engine
## Architectural Design Document

This document outlines the architecture for ALAN's Phase-Coherent Reasoning Engine, which extends the Phase IV semantic sovereignty components with a novel approach to logical inference based on oscillator dynamics and phase synchronization.

## 1. Overview and Philosophy

Traditional reasoning systems rely on either binary logic (true/false) or probabilistic inference (degrees of belief). The Phase-Coherent Reasoning Engine introduces a fundamentally different paradigm:

- **From Truth Values to Phase Coherence**: Logical consistency is measured by the stability and synchronization of phase relationships between concepts
- **From Inference Rules to Synchronization Dynamics**: Logical operations emerge from the natural dynamics of coupled oscillators
- **From Static Knowledge to Resonant Structures**: Valid knowledge structures are those that demonstrate stable phase-locked patterns

This approach offers several advantages:
- Natural handling of ambiguity and uncertainty without probability
- Emergence of contextual relevance through resonance
- Integration with existing phase-based knowledge representation
- Support for modal reasoning (necessary vs. possible truths)

## 2. Core Components

The Phase-Coherent Reasoning Engine consists of five core components:

- `get_network_coherence(network: PremiseNetwork) -> float`: Measures overall phase coherence
- `get_premise_signatures(network: PremiseNetwork) -> Dict[str, KoopmanSignature]`: Extracts Koopman eigenfunctions that characterize stable pattern

**Mathematical Foundations**:

- Mean-field coupling analysis
- Phase order parameters (e.g., Kuramoto order parameter r)
- Critical coupling strength estimation

### 2.2 Inference Testing Module (`inference_test.py`)

```

## 4. Mathematical Foundations

### 4.1 Phase Oscillator Dynamics

The core mathematical model underlying the reasoning engine is a system of coupled phase oscillators, described by:

$$\frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = \omega_i + \sum_{j=1}^N K_{ij} \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i)$$

Where:
- $\theta_i$ is the phase of oscillator i
- $\omega_i$ is the natural frequency of oscillator i
- $K_{ij}$ is the coupling strength between oscillators i and j

Synchronization occurs when oscillators align their phases, measured by the order parameter:

$$r e^{i\psi} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N e^{i\theta_j}$$

Where:
- $r$ is the coherence (0 = incoherent, 1 = perfectly synchronized)
- $\psi$ is the average phase

### 4.2 Koopman Operator Theory

Koopman operators provide a framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamics through the lens of linear operators:

$$[\mathcal{K}g](x) = g(F(x))$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{K}$ is the Koopman operator
- $g$ is an observable function
- $F$ is the dynamics

For phase oscillators, Koopman eigenfunctions capture stable synchronization patterns:

$$\mathcal{K}\phi_\lambda = \lambda \phi_\lambda$$

Where:
- $\phi_\lambda$ is an eigenfunction
- $\lambda$ is the corresponding eigenvalue

The reasoning engine uses Koopman eigenfunctions to:
1. Characterize stable premise networks
2. Predict how conclusions will affect stability
3. Identify modal patterns across different phase configurations

### 4.3 Phase-Coherent Logic

Traditional logic is reformulated in terms of phase relationships:

- **Conjunction (AND)**: Concepts must synchronize with both conjuncts
- **Disjunction (OR)**: Concepts must synchronize with at least one disjunct
- **Negation (NOT)**: Concepts must maintain antiphase relationship (π radians)
- **Implication (IF-THEN)**: Phase of conclusion aligns when premise is activated
- **Equivalence (IFF)**: Bidirectional phase locking

Logical validity emerges naturally from phase dynamics without explicit rules.

### 4.4 Modal Analysis Through Multiple Attractors

Modal reasoning is implemented through the analysis of multiple attractor states:

- **Necessary Truth**: Concept synchronizes in all stable attractor configurations
- **Possible Truth**: Concept synchronizes in at least one stable attractor
- **Impossible**: Concept disrupts coherence in all configurations
- **Contingent**: Concept synchronizes in some configurations but not others

The size of the basin of attraction for a configuration provides a natural measure of its "probability" without explicit Bayesian formalism.

## 5. Integration with Existing Components

### 5.1 Memory Sculptor Integration

The Reasoning Engine integrates with the Memory Sculptor through:

1. **Stability Enhancement**: Concepts that participate in valid inferences receive stability boosts
2. **Resonance Recording**: Inference relationships are recorded as resonance events
3. **Spawning Triggers**: Valid conclusions may trigger concept spawning
4. **Pruning Guidance**: Concepts that consistently disrupt coherence become candidates for pruning

Key integration points:
```python
# In reasoning_process.py
def update_memory_sculptor_states(reasoning_result: ReasoningResult) -> None:
    """Update Memory Sculptor concept states based on reasoning outcomes."""
    sculptor = get_memory_sculptor()
    
    # Boost stability for concepts in coherent inferences
    for concept_id in reasoning_result.coherent_concepts:
        state = sculptor.get_concept_state(concept_id)
        sculptor.update_concept_state(
            concept_id=concept_id,
            detected_desync=False,
            resonated_with=reasoning_result.conclusion_id,
            resonance_strength=reasoning_result.coherence_score
        )
    
    # Record desyncs for incoherent concepts
    for concept_id in reasoning_result.incoherent_concepts:
        sculptor.update_concept_state(
            concept_id=concept_id,
            detected_desync=True
        )
```

### 5.2 Ontology Refactor Engine Integration

The Reasoning Engine informs the Ontology Refactor Engine through:

1. **Merge Suggestions**: Concepts that consistently synchronize together become merge candidates
2. **Split Suggestions**: Concepts with bimodal phase behavior become split candidates
3. **Hub Detection**: Concepts that mediate synchronization between otherwise disconnected networks
4. **Ambiguity Resolution**: Phase conflicts help identify ambiguous concepts

Key integration points:
```python
# In reasoning_process.py
def inform_ontology_refactoring(reasoning_results: List[ReasoningResult]) -> None:
    """Use reasoning outcomes to inform ontology refactoring."""
    refactor_engine = get_ontology_refactor_engine()
    
    # Find consistently co-synchronizing concepts
    sync_pairs = extract_consistent_sync_pairs(reasoning_results)
    for concept_id1, concept_id2, sync_strength in sync_pairs:
        if sync_strength > 0.85:  # High synchronization threshold
            refactor_engine.suggest_merge_candidates(concept_id1, concept_id2)
    
    # Find concepts with bimodal phase behavior
    bimodal_concepts = extract_bimodal_concepts(reasoning_results)
    for concept_id, bimodality_score in bimodal_concepts:
        if bimodality_score > 0.7:  # High bimodality threshold
            refactor_engine.suggest_split_candidate(concept_id)
```

### 5.3 Ghost Label Synthesizer Integration

The Reasoning Engine provides information to the Ghost Label Synthesizer:

1. **Semantic Relationships**: Inference patterns reveal semantic relationships
2. **Conceptual Role**: How concepts function in reasoning contexts
3. **Logical Type**: Whether concepts serve as predicates, subjects, operators, etc.
4. **Modal Character**: Necessary vs. contingent nature of concepts

Key integration points:
```python
# In reasoning_process.py
def inform_label_synthesis(reasoning_results: List[ReasoningResult]) -> None:
    """Use reasoning outcomes to inform label synthesis."""
    synthesizer = get_ghost_label_synthesizer()
    
    # Extract conceptual roles from reasoning patterns
    concept_roles = analyze_conceptual_roles(reasoning_results)
    
    # Pass semantic relationship information to synthesizer
    for concept_id, role_info in concept_roles.items():
        synthesizer.register_semantic_role(
            concept_id=concept_id,
            logical_role=role_info.role,
            modal_character=role_info.modality,
            typical_premises=role_info.premise_contexts,
            typical_conclusions=role_info.conclusion_contexts
        )
```

## 8. Conclusion

The Phase-Coherent Reasoning Engine represents a fundamental reimagining of logical inference, replacing traditional truth values with phase dynamics and synchronization patterns. By building on ALAN's existing Phase IV components, it creates a unified system where knowledge representation, maintenance, and reasoning all operate on the same underlying principles of phase coherence.

This approach offers several advantages:
- **Emergence**: Complex logical relationships emerge from simple phase dynamics
- **Continuity**: Degrees of validity emerge naturally without ad-hoc probabilistic assignments
- **Context-Sensitivity**: Reasoning adapts to specific contexts through phase configurations
- **Integration**: Seamless connection with existing phase-based knowledge representation

The result is a reasoning system that more closely resembles the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of human cognition while maintaining mathematical rigor through its foundation in dynamical systems theory and Koopman operator analysis.
