Reinforcement learning Based Automated Design of Differential Evolution Algorithm for Black-box Optimization

Abstract: Differential Evolution (DE) is a powerful derivative-free optimizer, but no single variant is superior across all black-box optimization problems (BBOPs). This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework called rlDE that learns to design DE algorithms using meta-learning. The RL agent is implemented with a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), and generates DE configurations based on problem characteristics extracted via Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA).

The framework leverages meta-learning to enhance the generalizability of the meta-optimizer, enabling it to adapt more effectively across a diverse range of problem scenarios. The experimental results on BBOB2009 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
